# EnergyRAG
**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application in energy**

First of all is RAG-LLM, then I will do some experiments with NLP and Knowledge Graph. Just want to do something fun with GenAI

## RAG with OpenAI 

Here, for example, a user comes to us and has few reports in his database and he wants to quickly perform a query to get information from the reports.

I use 3 reports from the public Volve dataset; discovery report, completion report, and drilling report of well 15/9-F-15 A.

One of the challenge: These models seem not to analyze figures, tables, and charts. How can we do better?
