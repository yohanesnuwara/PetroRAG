A comprehensive analysis has been performed including seismic and structural interpretation, biostratigraphy, sedimentology, petrography, petrophysics, DST-test analysis and geochemistry. Finally, a resource analysis of the discovery and associated prospects has been performed. The exploration well 15/9-19 SR is located on the Theta Vest structure in the Sleipner Øst area. The well proved oil in Jurassic sandstones of the Hugin Formation."
8,Geological Report_80,"The 18 meter thick Hugin Formation was found to be completely filled with hydrocarbons to its base at 2882.0 m MSL TD was reached in Triassic sediments at 3110.3 m MSL. The primary objective of the well was to test the hydrocarbon potential in the Heimdal Formation of Paleocene age, which is the main reservoir for gas and condensate in the Sleipner Øst area. The formation was found deeper than prognosed and was water wet. The secondary objective of the well was to test the hydrocarbon potential of the Jurassic/Triassic. Well planning on the Theta Vest structure was based on interpretation of reprocessed ST8215R 3D survey data from 1991. The Top Hugin Formation horizon has been mapped after the well was drilled. Because of limited resolution of the seismic data and a weak reflector, the horizon has been difficult to interpret consistently. The Theta Vest structure and the oil trap is a dome-shaped structure. The structure has a well defined spill point to the east and is as a base case believed to be filled down to this point. However, several faults cutting the crest of the structure could be sealing the hydrocarbon accumulation off from spilling eastwards."
9,Geological Report_90,"The core logging, covering the lower part of the Middle Jurassic Hugin Formation and the uppermost part of the Triassic Skagerrak Formation, shows a high frequence of fractures in the cores. This indicates penetration of a zone of intense and complex faulting. The unfaulted thickness of the Hugin Formation has been estimated. The application of a pure or simple shear model, gives an unfaulted thickness in the range of 24 to 27 meters. The Hugin Formation in the 15/9-19 SR well is Callovian in age, probably of Late Callovian. The sandstones are interpreted to be deposited in a high energy marine environment, possibly a mouthbar setting. The reservoir interval consists of highly variable fine to coarse grained, well to poorly sorted, subarkosic arenite sandstones with good to excellent reservoir properties. The underlying Skagerrak Formation is completely tight due to extensive kaolinite and dolomite cementation. Within the Sleipner Øst area, the Jurassic and Triassic reservoir distribution is complicated 10STATOIL due to syndepositional tectonics and later erosion. The Hugin Formation sandstones are only identified in three of the wells in the area."
10,Geological Report_100,"The scattered well data and poor seismic resolution of the Jurassic and Triassic levels, make the mapping of sedimentary facies and thickness distribution of the Hugin Formation very uncertain. The Hugin Formation of the area consists of shallow marine shoreface, coastal plain/lagoonal, channel and possibly mouth bar deposits. It is suggested that a mouth bar system can have been developed in the Theta Vest area during the early stages of sea transgression onto the Gamma High area. The Theta Vest area may represent a site for increased sand thickness compared to what is observed elsewhere on the Gamma High. The petrophysical analysis of the Hugin Formation in the 15/9-19 SR well, results in a mean net/gross of 0.924, a porosity of 22.6%, a permeability of 2913.2 mD and a water saturation of 11.0%. One drill stem test has been carried out in the interval 2863.6 - 2880.5 m TVD MSL The maximum rate recorded is 1358 Sm3/d. The permeabilities estimated from the build-up analyses are approximately 914 mD. The extrapolated reservoir pressure is calculated to 327.7 bar. The oil and gas from Theta Vest have geochemical characteristics which are unlike those for any other fluids found elsewhere in the Sleipner area. The oil properties are consistent in indicating that this sample was generated from a non-clastic marine source rock or Jurassic shales (Draupne Fm.)"
11,Geological Report_110,"of an unusual facies composition. The Theta Vest area has been evaluated with respect to potentially prospects and leads. Resource estimates have been calculated for each prospect. The calculated resource estimates are Monte Carlo simulated results. The most probable resource estimate for the Hugin reservoir in the Theta Vest structure is 10.33x1O'Sm3 oil In place and 1.65x10'Sm3 associated gas phase in place. A recovery factor of 45% gives 4.55x10'Sm3 recoverable oil and 0.72x10'Sm3 recoverable associated gas phase. The estimates are based on the assumption that the oil-water contact is governed by the spill point of the Theta Vest structure. If the faults cutting the structure are sealing, several of the fault segments north, west and south of the Theta Vest structure can be hydrocarbon bearing. This would increase the resource potential of the area by several orders of magnitude. The evaluation of the Jurassic and Triassic reservoirs in the Sleipner Øst area will be continued on the present data."
12,Geological Report_120,"When new seismic and well data become available in 1994- 96, the area and the Theta Vest structure will be reevaluated. 11STATOIL 2 INTRODUCTION This report provides an evaluation of the 15/9-19 SR hydrocarbon discovery. The exploration well 15/9-19 SR is situated on the Theta Vest structure, which is located between the Loke structure and the north-westerly extension of the Sleipner Øst structure. Figure 2.1 shows the location of well 15/9-19 SR together with other drilled exploration wells in the neighbouring area. Block 15/9 was awarded in 1976, together with block 15/8, as Production License 046. The Theta Vest structure is located outside the area declared commercial (see Figure 2.2), with the following ownerships: Statoil (operator) 52.6% Esso 28.0% Norsk Hydro 9.4% Elf 9.0% Total 1.0% The drilling of the 15/9-19 SR well was performed by the rig ""Treasure Prospect"" at a water depth of 84 m. The well was drilled through the Loke Template situated approximately 3 km east of the well target. The maximum deviation during drilling was 61.4 degrees from vertical. The primary objective of the well was to test the hydrocarbon potential in the Heimdal Formation of Paleocene age, which is the main reservoir in the Sleipner Øst area. In case of discovery, the purpose was to complete the well as a producer and take it into production with the subsea well 15/9-C2H on the Loke structure. However, the Heimdal Formation was found deeper than prognosed and did not contain hydrocarbons."
13,Geological Report_130,"The secondary objective of the well was to test the hydrocarbon potential in sandstones of Jurassic/Triassic age. Oil was encountered in sandstones of the Middle Jurassic Hugin Formation. A structural cross-section along the well path given in Figure 2.3, illustrates the geology of the Theta Vest structure. The well was spudded on 18th Sept. 1992 and temporarily abandoned on 24th Sept. 1992. A re-entry was done on 18th Nov. 1992. The well was drilled to a total depth of 3110.3 m below sea level and was terminated in sediments of Triassic age. The testing and completion started 26nd March 1993. The well showed very good production properties. It was plugged and abandoned on 29th April 1993. In the following chapters, an evaluation of the Theta Vest discovery and neighbouring areas based on seismic interpretation, structural geology, biostratigraphy, sedimentology, mineralogy, petrophysics, DST-test analysis and geochemistry is presented."
14,Geological Report_140,This leads to an anlysis and conclusion on the probable resources of the discovery.

The ST8215R 3D survey was shot in 1982 and reprocessed in 1991. Well planning on the Theta Vest structure was based on interpretation of these data.
15,Geological Report_150,"The quality of the data is varying. The lower Tertiary section, including Top Heimdal Fm. is of poor quality in this area, whereas the Cretaceous section is better. The section below the Base Cretaceous Unconformity is of poor quality. The deep section suffers from some overmigration. The seismic data are processed with zero phase conversion using check-shot calibrated well logs. Log-calibration analyses, using ""Integrate"" modelling, have confirmed that the data are fairly close to zero phase. 3.2 VSP A vertical incidence VSP was shot in the well after TD was reached and casing set. The VSP covers the depth range 4580 to 846 m (MD RKB), of which the interval 4580 - 1480 m (MD RKB) had a level spacing of 20 m MD. The VSP data has contributed to correction of the velocities, well ties as well as the seismic mapping of major horizons on the Theta Vest structure."
16,Geological Report_160,"Figure 3.1 shows a composite plot of VSP spliced with a random line along the wellbore. The Base Cretaceous Unconformity is notably better defined on this VSP section than on the 3D seismic data, especially in the crestal area. The Top Mesozoic Sandstone however, fails to be properly resolved, as the rest of the deep section. The Heimdal Formation is resolved with more internal reflectors than on the 3D data. From visual inspection on Figure 3.1, a negative shift of 5 to 10 ms seems to be necessary for the VSP to match the seismic data. However, when checking the log times on several horizons and comparing them with the 3D seismic data, a general shift is not required (Figure 3.2). 3.3 Seismic interpretation Tie between the major horizons and the stratigraphy in the well is shown on Figure 3.2. Top Heimdal Formation and Base Cretaceous Unconformity were adjusted, based on the 16STATOIL well results and the VSP data. The Top Mesozoic Sandstone was interpreted after the well was drilled. 3.3.1 Top Heimdal Formation The Top Heimdal Formation reflector, representing top of the Heimdal sandstone, is interpreted regionally in the Sleipner Øst area."
17,Geological Report_170,"It is generally picked in a minimum reflection (white trough), since there is a marked increase in acoustic impedance from the overlying shales to the well consolidated sandstone reservoir. The Heimdal Formation was the primary target for this well. This reservoir came 50 m TVD deep according to prognosis and was water wet. The VSP data indicated that the Heimdal Formation reflector was picked approximaly 15 ms too high initially. The other reason for the depth-discrepancy is relatively high velocities in the overlying sediments compared to adjacent wells. Therefore the velocity map was adjusted accordingly (Figure 3.3 and Enclosure 1). The corrected Top Heimdal Fm. depth map is shown on Figure 3.4 and Enclosure 2. The quality of the Top Heimdal horizon is varying. On the Theta Vest structure this horizon is generally weak and hard to define."
18,Geological Report_180,"In the 15/9-19 SR well, the Top Heimdal Formation tie is on the onset of a black peak accordingly to VSP, but is interpreted on the seismic data 1/4 cycle higher, in the white trough. 3.3.2 Top Shetland Group This is generally the best defined reflector in the Sleipner Øst area, representing the top of the Cretaceous. It is picked in a strong white trough, as there is a marked increase of acoustic impedance from Tertiary sandstones and shales to Cretaceous chalk. 3.3.3 Top Blodøks Formation The Blodøks Formation is a marly formation near the base of the Shetland Group. In most wells, the top of this formation ties to the onset of a black peak. 3.3.4 Base Cretaceous Unconformity The Base Cretaceous Unconformity represents a fall in acoustic impedance on top of the Jurassic Draupne Formation in the Viking Group. The horizon is therefore picked on the maximum of a generally strong black peak. The horizon is of importance as it reveals the 17C) STATOIL Jurassic structuring, both regarding fault block delineation and dips. The Base Cretaceous Unconformity map is given in Enclosure 3 and Figure 3.5. In the 15/9-19 SR well, the seismic tie should be on two-way time 2.547 sec."
19,Geological Report_190,"according to the velocity log, which is on the maximum of a black peak according to the synthetic seismogram. Originally the B.C.U. was picked at 2.512 sec, one cycle higher. The new interpretation placed the Jurassic section in a down-faulted position (see Figure 3.6). The new seismic tie will not affect the Jurassic/Triassic interpretation in areas outside the down- faulted block. The B.C.U. reflector is seen to have less amplitude levels near the crest of the structures (see Enclosure 9 and Figure 3.7). A probable reason for this is thinning of the Draupne Formation, probably also thinning of the Heather Formation. 3.3.5 Top Mesozoic Sandstone The first occurence of sandstone below the Viking Group is denoted Top Mesozoic Sandstone regardless of stratigraphic position. In well 15/9-19 SR it equals the top Hugin Formation."
20,Geological Report_200,"As the Top Mesozoic Sandstone reflector is the top of a sandstone with generally higher acoustic impedance than the overlying shales, this should be picked at a minimum white trough. Due to the fact that the Viking Group in most Sleipner Øst wells is relatively thin, beyond the resolution of the seismic data, the horizon is hard to tie and interpret consistently. To this should be added that there is a great variation in sand quality and sand thickness throughout the Sleipner Øst area. The interpretation is consistent with and tied to the Top Hugin Fm."" interpreted on Sleipner Vest (Statoil, 1993c). In the 15/9-19 SR well the Viking Group is only 9.5 m thick. The top of the Hugin Formation is picked 7 ms below the BCU reflector. Top Mesozoic Sandstone time- and depth maps are shown on Enclosures 4 and 5 and also given in Figure 3.8 and 3.9. 3.3.6 Other horizons In the deepest parts of the seismic dataset, the following two horizons were picked (deeper than TD in 15/9-19 SR): - Top Smith Bank Formation (interpreted on selected lines). - Top Rotliegendes Gp."
21,Geological Report_210,"18STATOIL In the shallow section, the following events are picked: - Top Pliocene. - Top Utsira Formation. - Near Top Oligocen. - Base Utsira Formation. - Top Balder Formation. - Top Lista Formation. Internally in the Shetland Gp., Top Hod Fm. is interpreted. Based on the tie from the VSP, also the Grid Formation was picked. This appears to have an ""eye"" - shape, consistent with the sedimentological interpretation of this being a channel deposit."
22,Geological Report_220,"The areal extension of the Grid sands have not yet been mapped. Figure 3.6 illustrates the seismic picks in the Theta Vest area. Time and depth data for the various horizons are listed in Table 5.8. 3.4 Depth conversion Shallow horizons (above the Top Heimdal reflector) were depth converted using interval velocities derived from wells in the area. The Top Heimdal Formation was depth converted using the linear formula: Vz = V0 + kZ in which Vz = veolocity at depth z V0 = initial velocity k = compaction factor Z = depth (subsea). The ADLINVEL program estimates the linear velocity function which minimizes the depth difference between the observed and the estimated time/depth data. Based on analyses from 11 wells in the 15/9 block (including 15/9-19 SR), the minimum point for depth residuals occured at k= 0.346, whereas the minimum for standard deviation of V0 occured at k= 0.71 (see Figure 3.10). A similar analysis using the 5 vertical wells on the Gamma High only (15/9-9, -11, -13, -15, -16 and -17), resulted in minimum for depth residuals at k= 0.456. Bearing in mind that the well 15/9-19 SR is highly deviated, less weight is given to that well than to the vertical wells on the Gamma High. Also a larger k-value gives less standard deviation on the V0 values."
23,Geological Report_230,"Therefore k= 0.456 is chosen for the Theta Vest area as for the rest of the Gamma High. The time/depth relationship as well as velocities from 15/9-19 SR are shown in Figure 3.11. The abnormally high average velocities at Theta Vest, are probably contributed by the Grid sands which are much poorer developed in other wells on the Gamma High. The distribution of the Grid sands is likely to be restricted. 19STATOIL Horizons below Top Heimdal Formation were depth converted using interval velocity grids based on vertical velocities in the wells. Velocity grids were made for the following intervals: Top Heimdal Fm. Top Shetland Gp. Top Shetland Gp. Base Cret. Unc.Top Shetland Gp."

A core logging scheme for describing and mapping structures at a scale 1:5 was used, including drawings. 15 thin-sections were studied. The study showed that the rocks contain a high number of natural fractures. Frequency distribution is shown in Figure 4.1. The fractures are mostly small faults or deformation bands with displacements from a few mm to a few cm (Figure 4.2), and the fracture infill is highly variable in colour. When studied in thin section, it is observed that most deformation bands have grain crushing/grain size reduction (Figure 4.3). Porosity reduction is often one order of magnitude."
28,Geological Report_280,"Preferred orientation of quartz grain long axes is frequent, and some preferred growth of clay minerals seems possibly to have taken place in many of the deformation bands. According to researchers at Stanford University, deformation bands may be classified according to the change in porosity (unchanged, compaction, dilatation) and after presence of grain crushing (Antonelli et al., 1993). All these types were found in the core, but the grain crushing/porosity reduction was the most common. A deformation band with grain crushing and porosity reduction may be viewed as a result of strain hardening, whereas larger faults with localized slip surfaces represent strain softening products. Mechanically, these are different processes. A few larger faults were recognized by clay smear and striations. It seems that they form zones of weakness where the core easily parts under bending stress. A partial orientation of the core was made possible by the well deviation (about 40 degrees towards the west). In the west, there is a west-dipping, N-S striking large master fault, and faults were termed synthetic and antithetic relative to this. All clear cross-cutting relationships in the two cores were analyzed, and it was found that ""synthetic before antithetic"" was of similar frequency as ""antithetic before synthetic""."
29,Geological Report_290,"From this, it may be concluded that the faults observed were formed in a zone of intense and complex deformation. Antithetic and synthetic faults probably formed at roughly the 33CJ STATOIL same time. General dip of the bedding relative to a plane perpendicular to the core axis was measured in an attempt to record possible fault drag zones (dipmeter was not run due to technical problems). This method contains some uncertainties due to core orientation and observational difficulties due to massive rock etc. The oil stain and often massive character of the Hugin Formation made observations of general bedding dip difficult, especially in the Jurassic. Rotation of bedding was pronounced in two zones: (i) 4345-4348 m MD RKB (Triassic). This coincides with major (m-size?) faults with day smear and striations at 4345 (Figure 4.4) and 4347 m MD RKB. Fracture frequency is high in the upper part, and low in the lower part of the interval. (ii) 4355-4362 m MD RKB (Triassic)."
30,Geological Report_300,"No major fault has been recorded in this interval. Fracture frequency is low in the upper part (Figure 4.1), and medium in the lower part of the interval. Rotation may have been caused by slumping. Since grain crushing require some minimum value of the mean stress, it may be concluded that some overburden (Upper Jurassic shales) were present at the time of faulting. It is assumed that the Upper Jurassic tectonic phase is responsible for most of the fractures. Where displacements can be seen, they dominantly indicate normal faulting. In addition, syn-sedimentary faulting can be seen in the Triassic, especially in the lower part of core no. 3. These are characterized by small associated folding and a combination of normal and reverse faulting. A few post-consolidation reverse faults may be of Cretaceous age."
31,Geological Report_310,"The Jurassic is oil-filled troughout, but still contains a large number of deformation bands with a possible sealing potential. Sometimes these bands are light and in some cases very thick (up to 10 mm), indicating a ""seal"". Other bands are dark. See Figure 4.5 and 4.2. Both light and dark bands show grain crushing and significant porosity reduction under the microscope. A possible explanation is that tight light bands do seal, but the sealing property has a limited lateral extent, and that a significant oil coloumn has broken the seal of the more narrow, dark bands. This may possibly be due to differences in capillary displacement pressure. Altogether some 400 induced fractures were present in the two cores. They were easily recognized by not containing clay smear/striations or a deformation band of mm-thickness. They fall into two groups, one perpendicular to the core axis with ""clean"" joint surface (probably caused by bending), and one with joint ""swarms"" mainly parallel to the core axis and sometimes covered by drilling mud (possibly caused by torsion)."
32,Geological Report_320,"The structural core description is presented in detail in a separate report (Statoil, 1993f). 34STATOIL 4.2 Estimate of tectonic thinning of the Hugin Fm. in the position of well 15/9-19 SR Single-well hydrocarbon discoveries with poor seismic resolution give a drilled reservoir thickness that may not be representative for the reservoir within closure. A high degree of faulting by faults of varying size (most of them small) may have thinned the reservoir anomaleously at and near the well trace. A rough estimate of a representative reservoir thickness may be obtained using a pure- shear or simple-shear analysis based on data from structural core logging. All natural fractures found in the core were assumed to be shear fractures, and a mean displacement is applied to all fractures from (a limited number of) measurable displacements in the core. An initial fault dip of 60 degrees was assumed. The core part of 52 meter contained 829 fractures (assumed to be faults), with mean displacement of 31 mm based on 42 measurements. The ratio of antithetic faulting (roughly east-dipping) realtive to synthetic faulting was found to be 2:1. The following procedure was used to estimate tectonic thinning: 1."
33,Geological Report_330,"Structural core logging was carried out (see separate report; Statoil, 1993f). Displacements and numbers of fractures per meter were noted, and drawing of fractures were made. 2. The number of faults encountered in a well is dependent on deviation direction relative to fault plane orientations. The number of fractures (intensity) encountered was corrected for well deviation, recalculated from a 40 degree deviation to zero deviation, assuming horizontal bedding. Both pure-shear and simple-shear models for recalculation were used. 3. For a pure-shear model, tectonic thinning equals sum of throws on faults. 4. For a simple-shear model, a rotated fault block model (rotation is relative to disturbed bedding surface), including the shear angle, is expressing the thinning."
34,Geological Report_340,"The shear angle was found using a numerical procedure. The results for the Hugin Fm., well 15/9-19 SR (18 m vertical thickness in well position) is as follows: unfaulted thickness using pure-shear model is 27.0 m unfaulted thickness using simple-shear model is 24.7 m interpolated pure-shear/simple-shear model using observed ratio between antithetic and synthetic fractures gives an unfaulted thickness of 25.5 m. 35STATOIL Instead of reducing fault intensity to zero to obtain representative thickness, it may be reduced to a suitable background level, using comparable wells. The calculation of tectonic thinning of reservoir is described in a separate report (Statoil, 1993e). The method is of limited accuracy due to a limited data set, and lack of control on displacements larger than core dimensions. 4.3 Structural and tectonic development 4.3.1 Regional setting The Sleipner area is located in the south-eastern part of the Viking Graben. The area is situated close to the intersection point between some of the major structural elements of the North Sea. Major structural elements of the Sleipner region are given in Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7. At this intersection, the N(NE)-S(SW) striking Viking Graben intersects with the NW-SE striking Central Graben and also the NW-SE striking Norwegian-Danish basin. These strike directions (N-S, NE-SW and NW-SE) are also the dominant strike directions for faults and lineaments in the Sleipner area and have played an important role in the structuring and shaping of the area. The seismic attribute maps (Enclosure 6-11) reveal the lineaments in the Theta Vest - Loke area."
35,Geological Report_350,"The Triassic/Jurassic faults in the Sleipner area are plotted on the Top Mesozoic Sandstone depth map (Enclosure 5) and on the seismic interpretation of the Sleipner Vest Field by Statoil (1993c). A simplified map showing the main faults and lineaments in the Sleipner area is shown in Figure 4.8. Based on this map, some of the main structural features of the Sleipner area are reviewed. 4.3.2 The main fault zone The Sleipner area is divided into two major structural subareas, the Sleipner Terrace and the Gamma High, by a major fault zone of approximately 1000 m throw in the northern part of the 15/9-block (on Top RotJiegendes level). The fault zone is reaching a maximum 1500 m throw west of the 15/9-11 well and is down to approx. 1000 m west of well no. 15/9-9. The Sleipner Terrace is located to the west of the main fault zone on the downthrown side. To the west the Sleipner Terrace is bounded by the Viking Graben. The Sleipner Vest Field is located on this terrace."
36,Geological Report_360,"36STATOIL The Gamma High is located on the eastern upthrown side of the main fault. The Gamma High constitutes the southern extension of the Utsira High. The Sleipner Øst, Loke and Theta Vest are located on the Gamma High. The main fault zone follows two main directions (see Figure 4.8). In the south, between the Sleipner Øst Field and the southern part of the Sleipner Vest Field, the main fault strike dominantly N-S with a weak deviation towards a NW-SE direction. This direction is steady over a distance of more than 10 kilometer along the Sleipner Øst Field. An extension of the main fault can be followed for more than 10 kilometer south of the field out of the mapped area, as a distinct depression on the Base Cretaceuos map (see Figure 3.5). At the extreme north-western part of the Sleipner Øst Field, right south-west of the Theta Vest structure, the main fault direction changes sharply to a NE-SW direction. This direction can be followed for more than 10 kilometers towards north-east out of the mapped area. 4.3.3 The Sleipner Terrace area The Sleipner Vest Field is located in the west part of the Sleipner Terrace."
37,Geological Report_370,"Between the Sleipner Vest Field and the main fault to the east, there is a downfaulted basinal area. The Sleipner Vest Field consists of several major fault blocks. The shape and orientation of these fault blocks is governed by the three main fault and lineament directions N-S, NE- SW and NW-SE (see Figure 4.8). The overall general shape of the Sleipner Vest Field is an anticline. The southern fault blocks have an overall N-S orientation, while the fault blocks central on the field have an overall NE-SW orientation. This change in orientation coincides with the change in the orientation of the- main fault zone from N-S in the south to NE-SW in the north. It is found that the deepest and most well defined basin area between Sleipner Vest and the main fault zone is located in this northern area, and that this basin also have an NE-SW orientation. The main fault blocks of the Sleipner Vest Field are separated from each other by well defined NW-SE orientated faults and lineaments. This simplified picture is complicated by the fact that faults with the three main directions (N-S, NE-SW and NW-SE) actually are present over the whole field area, but to different degrees. Many of the faults around and within the main fault blocks are composite faults where all the three main directions are playing a part."
38,Geological Report_380,"As a simplification it can be said that N-S and NW-SE directions dominate in the southern part of the Sleipner Vest Field, NE-SW directions dominate in the central part and N-S NW-SE directions dominate in the northern part. In addition to these three main directions, also faults with E-W directions are found in the central and northern area of the field. This adds to the complicated structural picture of the Sleipner Vest Field. 37STATOIL 4.3.4 The Gamma High There is an apparent difference in the complexity of faulting between the Sleipner Terrace and the Gamma High area. On the Gamma High, including Sleipner Øst, Loke and Theta Vest, the number of mapped faults are few compared to what is observed on the Sleipner Terrace. Also the extension and continuity of the faults are significantly different. The faults on the Gamma High are generally scattered with a limited continuity. This is at least valid in the Post Triassic section. This difference implicates that the Gamma High is less influenced by faulting activity than the Sleipner Terrace. This can be explained by the fact that it has a more distant position to the Viking Graben area and the tectonics related to its formation."
39,Geological Report_390,"The observed difference between the two areas can also partly be explained by different influence from the Cretaceous and the Tertiary compressional phases: The Gamma High area and its structures are strongly influenced by doming during these phases. This may have resulted in reverse movements on faults, and thereby masked many of them from seismic resolution and mapping. On the Top Rotliegendes level however, the faults are large in extension and throw (see Enclosure 12 and Figure 4.9). 4.3.5 Structural links between the Gamma High and the Sleipner Terrace Despite the structural difference between the Gamma High area and the Sleipner Terrace, the two areas do have a common history. The fault and lineament directions on the Gamma High are similar to those on the Sleipner Terrace with the dominating directions N-S, NE-SW and NW-SE. Especially the NW-SE directed faults and lineaments connect the two areas. Although only scattered faults with this direction is observed on the Gamma High, it is found from the seismic attribute maps (Enclosure 6-11) that several distinct and continous lineaments with this direction cut across the Gamma High. The westward extension of these lineaments line up directly with many of the major NW-SE faults mapped over the Sleipner Vest Field and obviously are connected to these. Those lineaments also have significant influence on the shaping of the structures on the Gamma High. Many of the highs and lows on the Gamma High thus have an elongate shape orientated NW-SE."
40,Geological Report_400,"On the Sleipner Vest Field many of the NW-SE faults and lineaments are expected to be sealing due to changes in fluid contacts across them. On the Gamma High the main NW-SE lineament cutting across the Sleipner Øst Field, also must be sealing. This may explain the waterbearing Jurrasic/Triassic reservoirs to the south (wells 15/9-9 and 15/9-16) and hydrocarbon bearing Hugin Formation to the north (wells 15/9-11 and 15/9-13). 38STATOIL 4.4 Tectonic history The current interpretation seems to confirm the importance of regional lineaments as described in the litterature for this area (Pegrum 1984, Pegrum & Ljones 1984). The NW- SE direction could be an extension of the Tomquist Zone. The main bounding faults to the west and northwest of the Gamma High have directions that conform to the Viking Graben and to the Central Graben. The Tomquist Zone belongs to a set of northwesterly tectonic zones extending into the Fennoscandian - East European Precambrian basement platform. This can be traced from onshore Poland through Southern Sweden, Denmark, the Fjerritslev Fault, the Farsund Basin, the Stavanger Platform and the Sele High. Movements along this zone have occured during several periods and are interpreted to be the response of major plate-tectonic adjustments. An other fundamental lineament is the Highland Boundary Fault-Ling Graben Alignment."
41,Geological Report_410,"This extends in northeastern direction from the Highlands past southeastern part of the Utsira High, into the Ling Graben (Gage and Dore, 1987), see Figure 4.6. 4.4.1 Paleozoicum During the Caledonian and Variscan orogenic cycles, the general stress along the Tomquist Zone was compressional with right-lateral movements between the Fennoscandian-East European platform and the rest of Europe. In the Late Devonian, sedimentary basins with a north-northeast trend were formed in the central North Sea areas as an effect of wrench faulting. These basins were subject to widespread deposition of Old Red Sandstone and later also by Early Carboniferous sedimentation. During late Carboniferous, the Variscan compression gave an east-west dominating direction, especially in the southern North Sea. During Permian time, the North Sea area was subject to east-west extension with development of Oslo Graben, Bamle Through and Horn Graben. The Tomquist zone generally acted as a northeastern limit of the Zechstein Salt basin. In Permian time, the Gamma High in block 15/9, was probably a basin-margin area, based on results in wells 15/9-9 and 15/9-16. These wells proved 20 m and 56 m respectively of anhydritic Zechstein Gp. overlying the Rotliegendes Gp."
42,Geological Report_420,"shaley sandstone and breccia. In contrast, well 15/12-3 to the south had a Zechstein Gp. of 1154 m. Differences in the development of the Rotliegendes also indicates a more basin-margin environment in the Gamma High area. (Pegrum & Ljones 1984). In the Sleipner Terrace area, halokinetic movements probably have been of importance for the formation of the Sleipner Vest structuring, but it is uncertain how thick this salt has been. 39STATOIL 4.4.2 Mesozoicum In the northwestern Europe the Triassic was dominated by regional extension and rifting. During the early rifting phase the dominant lineament directions were north and northeast. The Viking Graben, Central Graben, the Egersund Basin and Moray Firth Basin were formed. The Gamma High, although being an extension of the Utsira High, still received sediments. The present thickness of Triassic sediments is in the order of 300-600m."
43,Geological Report_430,"The isochore map of Top Rotliegendes - Base Cretaceous Unconformity is given in Figure 4.10. Relatively thin Triassic sections in the wells 15/9-11, 15/9-13 and 15/9-16 suggest that parts of the Gamma High had relief during Triassic, resulting in non-deposition and/or erosion at this time (Pegrum & Ljones, 1984). The Mesozoic extension lead to a reversal of the movements along the Tomquist Zone, from right-lateral/compressional to left-lateral/extensional. There was a regional uplift during Early - Mid Jurassic in the central North Sea with erosion of high areas, also on the Gamma High. Earlier deposited sediments on the Gamma High were largely removed by erosion. There are abundant sandy deposits on the Sleipner Terrace of Bathonian - Callovian age and much thinner development on the Gamma High (of Callovian Hugin Formation). The Mesozoic extension culminated in Late Jurassic time. The western margin of the Gamma High consists of major normal faults with periodic movements associated with the development of the Viking Graben and Central Graben. There has apparently been a ""footwall uplift"" yielding a general dip down to the east and with most extensive erosion along the fault margin. During Late Jurassic the vertical movement of the western- and northwestern margin was 400-600m."
44,Geological Report_440,"On the Gamma High there are differences in amplitude between highs and lows for the BCU reflector. This is interpreted to be an effect of local thinning of the Viking Group on these high areas and consequently the structures were in development at least during Upper Jurassic time. This is also supported by observations of structures in the cores (see Chapter 4.1). During the Lower Cretaceous time, the area has been subject to compression with the result that faults were steepened and partly overturned. See Figure 4.11. This has also been observed during the latest seismic interpretation on Sleipner Vest (Statoil 1993c), During Upper Cretaceous there was subsidence and deposition of the marls and chalk of the Shetland Gp. 4.4.3 Cenozoicum Laramide tectonism and associated drop in sea level caused large paleogeographic changes in the North Sea Area (Ziegler, 1981). The Shetland Platform was subjected to uplift and erosion, giving rise to eastward directed output of clastic sedimentation. This eventually also reached the Sleipner area, providing Heimdal Formation reservoir sands. Some flexuring and faulting of the Top Shetland Gp indicates that faults bounding The Gamma High could have had a minor reactivation in the Paleocene."
45,Geological Report_450,"40STATOIL The last tectonic event of importance for the Gamma area occured in the Mid Tertiary in connection with Alpine folding. This event resulted in a regional compression and probably also reactivation of the Tomquist lineament, causing doming and creating the hydrocarbon trap in the Paleocene. A possible late phase of the Mid-Tertiary compressional event can be observed in the north-easterly extremes of the 15/9 block, causing local uplift. 4.4.4 Tectonic development of the Gamma High Based on the known stressfields, the observed lineaments and the stratigraphy encountered in the wells in the Sleipner area, the Gamma High is considered to consist of rotated fault blocks with a complex genetic history. From the seismic sections on Figure 4.11 and 4.12, it can be seen that there have been reversed movements of some deep faults. The major faults on the T. Rotliegendes level (Enclosure 12, Figure 4.9) can in some cases be traced up to the Base Cretaceous level, but then often with reversed displacement In some cases, the Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous is flexured over the deep seated block boundaries, and often this section thickens in local graben areas. The Top Rotliegendes, however, will locally be uplifted in some of these low areas, thus forming a pattern of repeated local inversions. See the vertical cross-section through Theta Vest and Theta Sør in Figure 4.13. This pattern can not be explained as result of a single dominating stressfield. Two models will be briefly discussed here: 1."
46,Geological Report_460,"Halokinetic model The structures on the Gamma High have some resemblance to ""turtleback structures"", being the result of differential loading, salt doming and subsequent salt-with-drawel: the clastic Post-Permian sedimentation would first be concentrated in local basins separated by salt doming. Upon salt drainage from the area, the former clastic depocenters would become local high areas and supply sediments for deposition in the former salt-dome regions. This model fails to explain the frequent reversals of major faults penetrating the Rotliegendes. Also this model requires initial salt deposition up to a thickness at which the salt becomes mobile, which is uncertain at the Gamma High (see Chapter 4.3.1), but it can not be excluded that this could have been a mechanism in eastern part of the 15/9 area. 2. Shear fault model Shear faulting will juxtapose fault blocks with different sediment thickness. From the known tectonic history, especially with respect to the shear movements along the Tornquist Zone, shearing could have has some impact on the tectonic development of the Sleipner area Restoration of the fault blocks is not possible with this model either, and the extension of the Tomquist Zone (at least the magnitude of shear movements) is uncertain. Several 41CJ STATOIL observed features, at least in the Post - Rotliegende section are consistent with the known movements along that lineament. First of all, the above mentioned thickening and flexuration of the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous sediments, is in agreement with the known extensional stress-field along the Tomquist Zone during that period. Furthermore the abundant NW-SE lineaments cut across to the Sleipner Terrace as well and seems to seperate distinctive fault compartments (see Chapter 4.2.6)."
47,Geological Report_470,"The net movements along the lineaments seems to be left-lateral, observed for example on the Sleipner Terrace as cutting local Jurassic basin axes. Paleocene horizons, like the Top Heimdal Formation seems to have an ""dome""-axis running south of well 15/9-11 in the NW-SE direction. Faulting and folding along this axis confirm Post-Paleocene compressional phase. Very locally there are indications of thrusting (on T.Shetland Gp. ), along the same lineament. See Figure 3.4, 4.8 and 4.14. Both Jurassic extension and Early Cretaceous and Tertiary compression appear to have been of importance for the development of the Theta Vest structure, as illustrated on the seismic section in Figure 4.15. Conclusion The ""Shear fault model"" seems to agree better with the observed data than a purely halokinetic model. The latter model seems insufficient in order to explain typical observations in the area. On the other hand, salt could have secondary importance locally, especially in eastern parts of the Gamma High."
48,Geological Report_480,"In areas surrounding the Gamma High, salt movements are thought to have accompanied movements of major faults and deposition of Triassic clastic sediments (Pegrum and Ljones, 1984). It is probable that the two NW-SE trending lineaments, bounding Theta Vest, have had major influence on the development of that structure. The fault blocks seem to be irrestorable in cross-section view (Figure 4.13), but shearing along the lineaments could explain this. 42WELL 15/9-19 SR Fracture frequencySTATOIL Measured 1 meter intervals Fracture frequency, fractures per meter 4328433043324334DQ 4336V 4338rj= 4340* 4342Q 4344§ 4346•* 4348p 4350fc 4352-C 4354 ""ri 4356S-4358ft 4360tJ 43624364436643684370437243744376437843804382 Extrapolated in the case of missing core Figure 4.1 Fracture frequencies along 1 meter intervals of cores 2 and 3.

In addition, the mineralogy and petrography of these sandstones, and their reservoir quality have been analysed. These data, together with the wireline logs and correlation to neighbouring wells, have been applied in the description of the sedimentary environment in the Sleipner Øst area. 5.2 Biostratigraphy Selective palynological analyses have been undertaken on core samples from the interval 4332.80 - 4380.96 m. In addition, selective new analyses have been undertaken on 15/9- 17 and integrated with existing data over the interval 2717.58 - 2739.55 m. Furthermore, existing datasets for the basal Heather - Hugin Formations in 15/9-9, 15/9-11, 15/9-13, 15/9-15 and 15/9-16 have been reviewed. The results from 15/9-19 SR are discussed in relation to these other sections. Figure 5.1 schematically illustrates the chronostratigraphy of these wells in relation to the Jurassic stratigraphy of wells in the Sleipner Vest area, as reported in Statoil (1993d). Depths referred to are drilled depths (RKB) unless stated otherwise. Core depths are therefore uncorrected.

The barren nature of the Skagerrak Formation sample at 4380.96 59STATOIL m precludes positive interpretation although such samples are suggestive of non-marine, high energy fluvio-deltaic or terrestrial, oxidised environments."
54,Geological Report_540,"Within the Hugin Formation, the marine acritarch Cyclopsiella spp. dominates assemblages at 4343.63 and 4340.65 m and is common at 4339.22 m. The abundance of this form suggests the possibility of stressed (shallow, high energy?) marine conditions at these levels. Dinoflagellate cysts are rare in the afore-mentioned samples but increase in numbers and diversity in the overlying interval 4334.63 - 4332.80 m. This suggests a slightly less ""stressed"", more ""normal"" marine environment although the dominance of a few species still indicates a relatively stressed (shallow?) marine environment. Miospores are extremely rare in the Hugin Formation indicating either minimal sediment input from a vegetated terrestrial source or destruction/winnowing in a high energy environment. The consistent presence of the alga Botryococcus spp. indicates minor input/runoff from a freshwater source. 5.2.4 Comparison with 15/9-9, -11, -13, -15, -16 and -17 wells The Hugin Formation in 15/9-19 SR is Callovian in age and probably Late Callovian. A more precise dating is hindered by the sandy and thereby relatively ""clean"" nature of the facies which restricts the recovery of age diagnostic palynomorphs."
55,Geological Report_550,"The age of this sandstone therefore probably correlates with the 15/9-11 Hugin Formation between the top of the formation at 2795.0 (log) and 2809.5 m where Middle Callovian sediments are identified. The section is also time equivalent to the 15/9-13 Hugin Formation between 2763.0 (log) and 2770.88 m. The lower part of the Hugin Formation in 15/9-13 cannot be precisely dated due to the presence of facies unfavourable for recovery of age -diagnostic palynomorphs. In 15/9-9, a time equivalent package is developed in the shale facies of the Heather Formation between the top of the formation at 2627.0 (log) and 2633.0 m where Middle Callovian sediments are identified. Time equivalent sections are not developed in either the 15/9-15 or 16 wells. In 15/9-15 an Early Oxfordian aged Heather Formation directly overlies presumed Triassic Skagerrak Formation sediments. In 15/9-16, presumed Triassic Smith Bank Formation sediments are overlain by Early Cenomanian aged Chalk Group sediments. Four core samples were prepared and analysed from 15/9-17 over the interval 2717.50 - 2739.45m. In addition, existing slides from the overlapping interval 2716.20 - 2755.33m were re-analysed.

65,Geological Report_650,"Only core no. 2 has been described in detail. It was the only one which was cut in the reservoir section.

66,Geological Report_660,"A more detailed description is given in Figure 5.4. The interval consists of light grey sandstones interbedded with some layers of greenish grey mudclast conglomerates. The interval is extensively cemented by kaolinite and dolomite (Chapter 5.5.3). The extensive cementation in this interval seems to hinder identification of sedimentary structures in the sandstones. The sandstones seem massive, but this may as mentioned, be due to the extensive cementation. Some weak parallel, inclined(?) lamination is observed. The grainsize is in the range very fine to fine. Abundant pyrite is observed. 69STATOIL The conglomerates consist of greenish grey, angular to subangular mudclasts of 0.5 - 4 cm size."
67,Geological Report_670,"The matrix consists of light grey, very fine to fine sandstone. The mudclasts show a horizontal parallel lamination. The base of the conglomerates are characteristically scoured. The conglomerates constitute the lower part of fining upward (FU) sequences, whereas the sandstones constitute the upper part. The FU-sequences varies from 0.5 - 2 m in thickness; the conglomerates constitute maximum 10-15 cm of this. In addition to abundant fractures, the interval seems to contain a fault zone; in the interval of about 4348 - 4350 m. This is seen as bed boundaries nearly parallel to the borehole; this is particularly clear for the greenish grey mudclast conglomerate in this interval. Interpretation No characteristic bioturbation has been identified in the interval, indicating a non-marine environment. The overall stacked fining upward sequences with scouring mudclast conglomerates at the base suggest channel deposits of fluvial origin. The lack of overbank deposits, may indicate a low sinousity braided stream. 5.4.2 The Jurassic section, the Hugln Formation Sedimentoloqical description of the interval 4328.00 - 4343.60 m The following section is a general description of the above mentioned core interval."
68,Geological Report_680,"A more detailed description is given in Figure 5.4. The interval consists mainly of clean sandstones. These sandstones are brownish due to oil staining, the coarser grained sandstones more oil stained than the finer. As previously mentioned the extensive oil staining and abundant fracturing, complicate the identification of sedimentary structures in this interval. The sandstones of this interval are divided into four facies, based on grainsize and sedimentary structures: Facies A Fine grained sandstone with parallel laminated mudstreaks. Slumped/distorted strata is observed. Moderately - strong bioturbation is observed in this facies. Some horizontal burrows, ~ 1 cm; possible Palaeophycus burrows. This facies is less than 30 cm thick, and constitutes a very minor part of the cored interval. Facies B - Fine to medium grained sandstone."
69,Geological Report_690,"Fairly homogenous, massive in appearence, some rare coarse floating quartz grains. Some concave non-parallel lamination; possible cross bedding. Weakly bioturbated; scattered Ophiomorpha burrows, < 1 cm, are observed. This facies is 1 - 1.5 m in thickness, and constitutes a major part 70STATOIL of the cored interval. Fades C - Medium to coarse grained sandstone. Some 2 - 3 mm quartz grains. Appears as stacked small, 10-20 cm, fining upward units, with scouring base. Possible cross bedding. Some rare burrows are observed. Fades D - This facies may seem similar to fades C, exept for the fact that the entire interval comprises a more uniformly medium to coarse grained sandstone."
70,Geological Report_700,"Some minor fining upward trends are observed in the only interval that contains this facies; 4328.80 - 4330.85 m. The fining upward trends are 50 - 75 cm thick, with no distinct scouring bases. Abundant concave non-parallel coaly streaks are observed. This is the only part of the cored interval that contains such coaly streaks. Possible trough cross bedding is observed. The observed thickness of this facies is about 1.5 m. Facies A, B and C are vertically stacked in what seems to be an overall fining upward sequence, with facies C as the coarsest and lowermost facies in the FU-sequence. However, the observed stacking pattern may not be the correct stratigraphical stacking pattern, due to the extensive fracturing/faulting seen in the core. Facies D comprises the uppermost part of the cored interval. In addition to abundant fractures, the interval seems to contain two fault zones; in the interval of about 4336 - 4338 m and in the interval of about 4339.5 - 4341 m. These fault zones are seen as extensive fractured intervals, with very sharp, ""abnormal"" grain size changes. Interpretation It is difficult to be conclusive regarding the environmental setting of these sandstones of the Hugin Formation. Bioturbation and the identified trace fossils give a marine setting, the low diversity and abundance of trace fossils though indicating a stressed environment."
71,Geological Report_710,"The overall fining upward sequences of facies, with scouring bases, indicate a channelized setting; where facies C is interpreted to be the base of the channel deposits. The uppermost facies D, with increased carbonaceous material, may indicate a shift towards a more extensive eroding channel. Biostratigraphical analyse (Chapter 4.2) has identified fresh water algae in the interval 4332.80-4339.22, indicating run-off from a fresh-water source. A combination of shoreface deposits and more fluvial(?) channels are proposed as depositional environment for these sandstones of the Hugin Formation; this may be a part of a mouth bar setting. 71STATOIL 5.4.3 Conclusions Enclosure 13 shows a comparison of the core description and a suite of wireline logs. The sediments of the Triassic Skagerrak Formation is interpreted to be channel deposits of fluvial origin. The sediments of the Jurassic Hugin Formation is interpreted to be deposited in a possible mouth bar setting, although it is difficult to be conclusive regarding depositional environment. 5.5 Mineralogy and petrology Whole rock x-ray diffraction (XRD), petrographic point count, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis data from cored intervals of the 15/9-19 SR well have been performed by Statoils Geological Laboratory, in order to characterize the mineralogy and petrography of these sandstone units and evaluate the controls on reservoir quality. The following summary has been specially prepared for this Theta Vest discovery well report The data presented here are from the following cored intervals: Formation Interval (mD MSL) Samples Heimdal 3643.00 - 3645.50 6 Hugin 4328.85 - 4343.25 16 Skagerrak 4344.25 - 4354.00 11 All samples have been examined by whole rock XRD, and selected samples by thin section petrography/SEM analysis."
72,Geological Report_720,"5.5.1 The Heimdal Formation (Rogaland Gp., 3643.00-3645.50 m) The 2.5 m Heimdal Fm. interval examined consists of uniform, fine to medium grained, subarkosic arenite sandstones. Whole rock XRD analyses (Table 5.10) show the extremely uniform petrologic composition of this interval, which is characteristic of the Heimdal Fm. in the area. Weight percent quartz ranges from 80 to 84, and the sandstone has equal amounts of plagioclase and K-feldspar. Chlorite makes up most of the approximately 5 72STATOIL weight percent clay minerals, along with minor amounts of illite. Petrographic analysis data (Table 5.11) is consistent with the XRD petrologic results, and indicate about 2 - 4 volume percent quartz cement. The petrographic data also show anomalous low intergranular macroporosity values of 5 - 11 volume percent. On average, this accounts for only about 34 % of the total Helium porosity measured by conventional core analysis (average He porosity = 26 %). Substantial amounts of microporous dispersed clay and clay matrix (Figure 5.5) are mainly responsible for this large discrepancy, and also probably for the anonymously low measured core permeabilities (12-40 mD)."
73,Geological Report_730,"Because this petrologic feature may represent a more extreme development related to resistivity transition zone problem of the Sleipner Øst Field, it was investigated further. Special day mineral XRD analyses were performed on samples from 3644.50 and 3645.00 m in order to better characterize the dispersed clay and clay matrix observed by petrographic analysis. The less than 2 micron and less than 0.5 micron clay fractions were examined. The results show that all four separates consist predominantly of iron-rich chlorite, with minor amounts of illite/smectite (5 - 10 % expandable layers). The results confirmed petrographic observations that the dispersed clay is mainly derived from detrital clay matrix, clasts, and pellets. SEM observations (for example: 3644.50 m) indicate that diagenetic recrystallization or alteration of the clay has also occurred (Figure 5.6). These results will be integrated into the Sleipner Øst petrologic investigation of the resistivity transition zone. 5.5.2 The Hugin Formation (Vestland Gp., 4328.85-4343.25 m) The 15m Hugin interval examined consists of highly variable, fine to coarse grained, well to poorly sorted, subarkosic arenite sandstones with good to excellent reservoir properties. Whole rock XRD analyses (Table 5.10) show 55 - 94 weight percent quartz, with K- feldspar and no detectable plagioclase, except in the deepest sample (4343.25 m), which may represent reworked material from the underlying Skagerrak Formation. Clay minerals consist mostly of variable amounts of kaolinite (3 - 28 weight %), and lesser amounts of illite."
74,Geological Report_740,"Petrographic analysis data (Table 5.11) show the variable grain size and sorting of these lithologies, and also indicate that diagenetic quartz cement ranges from 2 to 11 volume percent, and generally increases with depth. The intergranular macroporosity varies from 25 - 8 volume percent, and on average accounts for 79 % of the Helium porosity measured by conventional core analysis. The remainder is mostly accounted for by secondary pores in dissolved feldspars, and microporosity in clay minerals. Because of the variable grain size and clay content, which are the main controls on permeability (Figures 5.7A & B), porosity and permeability are poorly correlated (Figure 5.7C). Variation in grain size, sorting, and reservoir quality is readily evident from the examination of three examples using photomicrographs from full diameter, blue epoxy impregnated thin sections (4330.25, 4331.25 and 433325 m, Figures 5.8, 5.9 and 5.10 respectively). More than over two orders of magnitude difference in permeability (15300 vs. 115 mD) is exhibited by samples only 1 meter apart (4330.25 and 4331.25 m) with only 0.5 difference in porosity (25.2 vs. 24.7 %). The difference is primarily due to grain size and clay content. 73STATOIL 5.5.3 The Skagerrak Formation (Hegre Gp., 4344.25-4354.00 m) The Skagerrak interval examined consists of fine to very fine grained subarkosic arenites sandstones, siltstones, and shales with poor reservoir quality. Only whole rock XRD data (Table 5.10) was acquired over this interval due to low economic interest of these lithologies (permeabilities generally less than 1 md). Quartz contents of the Skagerrak samples range from 36 - 50 weight percent, with approximately equal amounts of plagiociase and K-feldspar."
75,Geological Report_750,"Carbonate is predominantly dolomite, with up to 11 weight percent. Kaolinite makes up most of the clay mineral content, with 29 - 44 weight percent, and lesser amounts of mica-illite. The fine grain size and high clay content of the Skagerrak are mainly responsible for the poor reservoir quality of this formation. 74Table 5.10 Whole rock x-ray diffraction analyses data In semlquantltatlve weight percent.

79,Geological Report_790,"sandstones (well 15/9-9) or as a combination of sandstones of Jurassic/Triassic age (well 15/9-17). However, the age of these latter sandstones are in some cases disputable (e.g. well 15/9-17, 15/9-15, 15/9- 9). Except from the 15/9-19 SR well, which proved oil, the Jurassic and Triassic reservoirs are filled with gas and condensate. The well 15/9-9 is found waterbearing whereas no reservoir is present in the 15/9-16 well at this level. The fluid contacts are different in each well. An overview of the contacts, probable hydrocarbon columns and reservoirs in each well is given in Figure 5.11. A short summary of the geological evolution on the Gamma High and the Jurassic and Triassic stratigraphy in the wells, is given below. Where nothing else is indicated, the geological evolution is taken from Statoil (1984). The fades relations, paleo environment and sediment distribution of the Hugin Formation in the Gamma High area, is also discussed."
80,Geological Report_800,"5.6.1 Deposition of Jurassic and Triassic sediments During Triassic time, the Gamma High was subaerially exposed and continental deposits characterize this period. Argillaceous sediments assigned to the Smith Bank Formation constitutes most of the Triassic intervals encountered in the wells. These sediments were probably deposited in a lacustrine or muddy floodplain environment. Rejuvenation of source areas during the Triassic resulted in an influx of arenaceous detritus which characterizes the Skagerrak Formation. The Skagerrak Formation is generally thinner than the Smith Bank Fm. and in some places absent. The formation is believed to represent continental deposits of braided stream/floodplain origin. Rising sea level during the Early Jurassic, led to marine conditions and sedimentation throughout the South Viking Graben and the Sleipner Terrace. There is however no direct biostratigraphic evidence of Early Jurassic sediments in the Gamma High area. Some of the sandstone reservoirs on the Gamma High, which lack age diagnostic fossils and show marine sedimentary structures, may be of Early - Middle Jurassic age."
81,Geological Report_810,"Jurassic sediments are thin on the Gamma structure compared to the Sleipner Terrace to the west. The Jurassic, in the Sleipner Øst wells, is represented by sediments of Middle to Upper Jurassic age (Hugin, Heather and Draupne Formations). In the Sleipner Vest Field, thick Middle Jurassic Bathonian - Bajocian Sleipner Fm. and Callovian Hugin Fm. 77STATOIL sandstones are developed. Middle Jurassic sediments, older than the Hugin Fm., may have been deposited on the Gamma High. The sediments may then have been subsequently eroded, contributing as a clastic source area to the Callovian (Hugin Fm.) sands deposited on the Sleipner Terrace to the west (Cockings et al., 1992). Corresponding to three major phases of sediment accumulation, the Hugin Formation previously was divided into three main units, A, B and C (Statoil, 1983a). In a study concerning the reservoir geology of the Sleipner Vest Field, a new reservoir zonation based on a sequence stratigraphic framework has been established (Statoil, 1993a)."
82,Geological Report_820,"In this study, an overall backstepping depositional pattern is observed in the Sleipner Vest area, with the oldest sandstones (Early Callovian) deposited in the north, block 15/6, and the youngest sandstones (Late Callovian) deposited in block 15/9 (see Figure 5.1). The overall backstepping pattern is caused by a stepwise transgression of the Sleipner Vest area, though interupted by regressive events. This is seen as a result of the retreating phase of the Brent delta megasequence southwards. A flooding event in Early-Middle Callovian time is believed to represent the initiation of the overall backstepping. The majority of the Hugin Formation sandstones in the Sleipner Vest area were deposited during Middle to Late Callovian time (Statoil, 1993a). The western margin of the Gamma High restricted deposition during Early and Middle Callovian (Statoil, 1983a). The majority of the Hugin Formation sandstones on the Gamma High were deposited during Late Callovian. The present-day distribution of the Hugin Fm. sandstones are highly variable over the Gamma High structure. The thickness vary from 36 m (e.g."
83,Geological Report_830,"well 15/9-11) to no Hugin Fm. sands at all (e.g. well 15/9-16). This can be explained by non-deposition or later erosion. In Early to Mid-Oxfordian, the Hugin Fm. sandstones were overlain by open-marine shales of the Heather and Draupne Formations. At the end of the Oxfordian, the relative rise of sea-level was sufficiently high to have eliminated any sand deposition in the Sleipner area. 5.6.2 Jurassic and Triassic stratigraphy in the wells The observed and interpreted thicknesses of the Draupne, Heather and Hugin Formations in the seven exploration wells on the Gamma High, are listed in Table 5.12. In the 15/9-16 well the Jurassic section is entirely absent. The Cretaceous Shetland Group directly overlies the Triassic Smith Bank Formation."
84,Geological Report_840,"No reservoir is encountered in the Smith Bank Formation. In well 15/9-9 the Jurassic sequence is represented by a 17 m thick Viking Group (Draupne and Heather shales). The underlying sandstones proved to be barren of fossils and have by RRI (1981) been ascribed to the Triassic Skagerrak Formation. They assume a terrestrial setting of the whole section. On the other hand, based on fades changes and borehole log responses, the cored interval has by Statoil (1982) been subdivided in two 78O STATOIL informal subunits; an upper unit (2648 - 2703 m core depth) of marine clastic beach facies and a lower unit (2703 - 2755 m core depth) of coastal alluvial plain facies. The possibility that at least the upper part is Jurassic in age, either a Hugin Fm. equivalent or a marine Early to Middle Jurassic sandstone, can therefore not be ignored. The well proved to be waterbearing, but the cores show abundant staining of residual hydrocarbons. In the 15/9-17 well, gas and condensate are found in Jurassic and Triassic sandstones with gas down to the Triassic Smith Bank Formation. These sandstones are capped by a 3 m thick Jurassic shale sequence."
85,Geological Report_850,"Based on the core descriptions, Statoil (1983c) has divided the reservoir sandstones in an Upper Mesozoic sandstone unit (2741 - 2741) m RKB and a Lower Triassic Skagerrak Fm. unit (2741 - 2847) m RKB. The uppermost 2 m of the Mesozoic section is interpreted as a possible Hugin Fm. equivalent Due to the lack of age diagnostic taxa, the age of the Mesozoic sandstone unit are indeterminate. Three alternative interpretations are considered possible. The section is: a) attributed to the Hugin or Sleipner Formation. There is no positive palynological evidence of these formations, although this could be due to the occurence of unfavourable paleo-environmental conditions. b) a marine Early to Middle Jurassic. There is no positive biostratigraphic evidence for this. c) Triassic."
86,Geological Report_860,"The main argument against this alternative, is that a continental environment was widespread in Triassic. The thickness of the Viking Group in well 15/9-19 SR, is only 9.6 m. The underlying Hugin Fm. reservoir, which is 18 m thick, is heavily faulted. The Hugin Formation is interpreted to represent a possible mouth-bar setting (see Chapter 5.4.2). The oil is accumulated down to the Triassic Skagerrak Fm. interval, which is completely tight due to extensive dolomite and kaolinite cementation. The Jurassic sequence in well 15/9-13 is made up of 23.5 m of Upper Jurassic shales deposited over 26.5 m of the Hugin Formation. The Hugin Fm. sands are filled with gas and condensate down to the Triassic Smith Bank Formation. The upper part of the Hugin Formation is interpreted to be a progradational lower to upper shoreface sandstone, whereas the lower part is interpreted to be lagoonal/tidal flat deposits."
87,Geological Report_870,"Well 15/9-11 drilled a somewhat thicker Upper Jurassic shale section, totally 42.5 m. The underlying gas and condensate bearing Jurassic Hugin Fm. sandstone is 35.5 m thick. The depositional environment is interpreted to be progradational lower to upper shoreface sandstone. This is based on log interpretations, as the Hugin Formation was not cored. In well 15/9-15 as much as 70 m shales of the Jurassic Viking Group directly overlies sandstones which constitutes a 99 m gas bearing interval. As in the 15/9-9, Statoil (1983b) has subdivided the cored interval in an upper suggested foreshore/shoreface sand unit (2821 - 2860.5 m RKB) and a lower alluvial sand unit (2860.5 - 2948 m RKB). No age 79STATOIL evidence has been obtained from the upper interval. It has so far proven to be barren of palynomorphs. Three alternative interpretations of their age seem possible: a) Callovian Hugin Formation. The main argument against this alternative is that the lithology is atypical of the Hugin Formation."
88,Geological Report_880,"The main argument for a Callovian age is the marine influence. b) marine Early to Middle Jurassic Formation. The gradual transition from terrestrial conditions into marine, which are seen in the cores, may reflect transgressions in the Early to Middle Jurassic. c) Triassic. The cores are indicative of marine environment, whereas the environment was continental in Triassic. 80Table 5.12 Thicknesses of the Draupne, Heather and Hugln Formations observed In the 15/9 exploration wells In the Sleipner Øst area.

89,Geological Report_890,"The reservoir section in well 15/9-19 SR has not a straight forward correlation with the wells on the Loke, the Sleipner Øst and the My structures. The correlation is uncertain due to: the questionable dating of the reservoir section in the 15/9-17 and 15/9-15 wells and the cored section in the 15/9-9 well the very large distances between the wells (ca. 2-16 km), which makes the correlation very difficult the different depositional environments of the sandstones sparse data. 5.6.4 Facies relations, depositional environment and sediment distribution It has not been possible to determine the age of the sandstones in the wells 15/9-9, -15 and -17. They could probably represent deposits of Early - Middle Jurassic age. In the Sleipner Øst area, the Hugin Formation is therefore with certainty only identified in the 15/9-11, -13 and -19 SR wells. Only these wells can be used in the sedimentological analysis of the Hugin Formation. The 15/9-11 well has also limited value for such analysis, because the Hugin Formation was not cored in this well. Only two wells have been cored in the Hugin Formation (15/9- 19 SR and 15/9-13). In one of them (15/9-19 SR), the Hugin Formation is heavily faulted."
90,Geological Report_900,"The well data information of the Hugin Formation is thereby very limited and scattered. In addition, the present seismic data is generally of poor quality and resolution in the Jurassic and Triassic sections. It has not been possible to pick the base of the Top Mesozoic Sandstone reflector from the seismic. The thickness distribution of the Hugin Formation sandstones has therefore not been possible to picture. The seismic interpretation so far, has only been completed in the Theta Vest - Loke area and does not cover the area south of the wells 15/9-11 and -13. The limited data available exclude a detailed analysis and mapping of thickness and facies distributions of the Hugin Formation in the Sleipner Øst area at present. A more generalized description and analysis is however attempted. Depositional environment and facies relations. Sedimentological and biostratigraphical analyses of the cored sections in the 15/9-13 and 82O STATOIL 15/9-19 SR wells have been performed. The biostratigraphic data from the 15/9-13 well, conclude that the upper part of the Hugin Formation is marine, while the lower part lack diagnostic fossils (see paragraph 5.2.4)."
91,Geological Report_910,"The sedimentological analysis interprets the upper part as marine shoreface and the lower part as lagoonal. Both the biostratigraphic and sedimentologic data interpret increasing marine influence upwards through the formation. The biostratigraphic data from the 15/9-19 SR well, conclude that the cored section is marine with some minor input/runoff from a fresh water source indicated by the presence of alga (see paragraph 5.2.3). The lower part of the cored interval contains marine fossils indicative of a shallow marine, high energy ""stressed"" environment. The upper part of the core interval contains marine fossils, which indicate more normal and less ""stressed"" environment. This indicates a general increase in marine influence upwards through the cored interval. The sedimentological analysis of the cored interval in the 15/9-19 SR well, interprets the formation as a combination of shoreface deposits with channels. These channels could represent fluvial channels in a mouthbar setting (see paragraph 5.4.2). Based on logs and biostratigraphy, the Hugin Formation in the 15/9-11 well is interpreted to be marine. Coarsening upwards sequences seen on the GR and SP logs are interpreted to represent prograding systems in a shoreface environment (Statoil, 1982)."
92,Geological Report_920,"In the neighbouring block to 15/9, the 16/7 block, the Hugin Formation is identified in two wells. It is the 16/7-2 well, situated northeast of the Loke structure, and the 16/7-3 well, situated east of the 15/9-11 well. The formation has been described by Esso (1987) as a progradational unit developing from shoreface to beach to coastal plain to channelized sandstone capped by a marine shoreface sandstone. The shallow marine sandstones in the 16/7 block are of Late Callovian to Early Oxfordian age (Esso, 1987). Since the Hugin Formation of the Gamma High area mainly were deposited in the Middle to Late Callovian time, the age of the sandstones in the 16/7 block supports the backstepping model for the Hugin Formation deposition suggested by Statoil (1993a). In summary, the fades described above for the cored wells, in the 15/9 and 16/7 blocks, suggest a coastal depositional system including shallow marine shoreface deposits, coastal plain/lagoonal deposits and channel deposits. The coastal plain/lagoonal deposits are observed in the wells located to the south east (15/9-13 and 16/7-3). This suggests an onshore to offshore direction towards the northwest in the 15/9 and 16/7 block. The description of deposits in the 16/7 wells indicates one main progradation of the depositional system, terminated by a transgressive retreat in the uppermost part. The maximum progradation of the coastline will be located somewhere between the 15/9-13 and 83STATOIL the 15/9-19 SR well."
93,Geological Report_930,"Schematic paleogeographic maps of the Late Callovian and Mid Oxfordian, are shown in Figure 5.12 and 5.13. The maps show the main areas of erosion/non deposition and shallow marine upper shoreface sand deposition in blocks 15/9, 16/7, 15/12 and 16/10. Sand distribution and thickness variation. The interpretation of channel deposits in the 16/7 wells and also in the 15/9-19 SR well, implies the possible presence of a fluvial system in the area. A mouth bar setting has been suggested for the 15/9-19 SR well. This implies the possible formation and preservation of mouthbar deposits connected to the fluvial channel system. The 15/9-19 SR well is located close to the main fault zone boundary between the Gamma High and the Sleipner Terrace. It is known that there is a significant increase in the thickness of the Hugin Formation across this fault zone in the Sleipner Terrace area (Statoil 1993a). The fault zone could have represented a fault escarpement established before depositon started, but it could also have been active during deposition. This zone area therefore would represent a likely position for the developement of possible mouth bar accumulations."
94,Geological Report_940,"In this area, accomodation space may have been generated through depositon time, with the possibility of much thicker accumulations of the Hugin Formation than what is typically observed in the wells situated on the main Gamma High area. The Theta Vest area is located at the north-west end of several of the NW-SE lineaments and connected structural depressions located between the Sleipner Øst structure and the Loke structure. Possible fluvial channel systems may have been guided towards the Theta Vest area along such depressions. The fluvial system may have been sourced from the elevated Sleipner Øst structure to the south. It is therefore suggested an increasing thickness of the Hugin Formation in the areas close to the Theta Vest structure. This would include the fault-blocks mapped north, west and south of the Theta Vest structure and also the down-faulted side of the main fault zone. The isochore map of the Viking Group reveals distinct increases in its thickness within these fault blocks. The thickness changes and variations are obviously linked to the fault blocks. This is illustrated in the isochore map of the BCU - Top Mesoz. Sandstone in Figure 5.14."
95,Geological Report_950,"Very thick shales (100-150 m) are found in the fault block right north of the Theta Vest structure. East of this, is another fairly well defined fault block with thicknesses in the range of 40-60 m. On the structural highs in the area (e.q. on the Theta Vest and Loke), the thickness is only in the range of 10-20 m. Although erosion of the Jurassic shales most certainly have occured over much of the area, the present thickness distribution probably also relates to the primary thickness distribution. As synsedimentary faulting can be assumed during the deposition of the Hugin Formation, it is also likely that there is some relations between the thickness distribution of the 84STATOIL Jurassic shales and the primary thickness distribution of the Hugin Formation. The thicknesses of the Hugin Fm. sandstones can be expected to be larger in depressions and down thrown areas, compared to what is observed on the highs. The presence of an active fluvial system in the Loke and Theta Vest area, with an associated developement of mouth-bar deposition in the Theta Vest area, must be linked to the early stages of transgression of the sea onto the Gamma High. 85THE SLEIPNER AREA Middle to Late Jurassic ChronostratigraphyO STATOIL Theto West Sleipner East (15/9-19SR) (15/9-11.13)Sleipner West ""Central"" (15/9-12,6,2.4)Sleipner West ^South'115/9-16 Area (Cenom)Sleipner West ""North"" (15/9-1)15/6 - 15/9-3 Area Chronostrotigrophy Drauprr Heather Fm Hugin Fm MixedSleipner/Huginfades. eipner/SectionAbsentSleipner Fm ui LTEK/A93/U07Draupne Fm t I Heather Fm [ I Hugin Fi Sleipner Fm (Triossic) Section AbsentVVCLL io/y- Drillinn nmnnnQi SS:!i;,fVf.

A preliminary check of the pressure response away from the near wellbore area has also been done by matching the data to constant pressure type curves. The DST #1 has a pressure response away from the wellbore which indicates pressure barriers. There are signs of a pressure barrier approximately 65 m from the well. In addition, there are boundary effects approximately 120-260 m from the well. These can be identified as a combination of pressure barriers and an increase in flow capacity away from the well. The test results indicate an oil-bearing formation with very good production capacities."

111,Geological Report_1110,"See Figure 7.2 and 7.3. An analytic model based on a set of pressure boundaries has been used to produce synthetic pressure data to fit the measured data. Parallel no flow barrier 60 and 255 m from the well, together with a perpendicular constant pressure boundary 125 m from the well, give a good match between synthetic and measured data. See Figure 7.4. The permeability is calculated using data from the main pressure build-up period. The test analysis give a permeability of approximately 900 mD. The average core permeability varies between 310 mD and 2.9 D, for various methods. Based on core observations and log data, the permeability distribution is expected to be non homogeneous, hence the test permeability is believed to correspond with the core and log data.

112,Geological Report_1120,"By taking the well deviation (in the perforated interval) of 50.2 degrees into account, a damage skin of 1.7 can be calculated. Perforation with high underbalance is supposed to stimulate the near wellbore effects. However, experience from the Statfjord Field shows that high rates give positive skin as a result of pressure loss through the drill stem between the perforated interval and pressure gauges. A skin of 1.7 is the equivalent of a pressure loss of 1.8 bar. This is within the expectations of a hydraulic frictionloss between the perforated interval and the pressure gauges (197 m MD), given a heavy and high viscous oil, with a flowrate of 1,310 Sm3/d. The extrapolated reservoir pressure is calculated to 327.7 bar. Max. temperature during the cleanup flow was measured to 106.2 °C.

Gas analysis were done by IFE. Oil analyses were performed by Statoil's Geochemistry Dept., with the exception of sulphur content (Production Laboratories, Statoil) and isotopic analyses (IFE). Data for well 15/9-19 SR have been compared with results from recent studies of gas, condensate and oil samples from Sleipner Øst/Loke and Sleipner Vest. General information on DST#1, together with gas:oil ratios (GOR), H2S concentrations and API gravity of the oil from rigsite reports, are given in Table 8.1. 8.1 Geochemical properties of gas from DST#1, well 15/9-19 SR The chemical and isotopic composition of the gas is given in Table 8.2 and is shown graphically in Figs. 8.1 and 8.2. The chemical composition of the gas is comparatively normal in that it falls within the range generally found in the North Sea province, albeit with relatively high carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. However, the isotopic composition is very unusual compared to the normal trend of steadily increasing (""heavier"") carbon isotope values with increasing carbon number."
115,Geological Report_1150,"The gas from well 15/9-19 SR shows a ""zigzag"" pattern of increasing and decreasing, but always unusually light, isotope values on going from methane to ethane, propane and the butanes (Fig. 8.2). 8.2 Geochemical properties of oil from DST#1, well 15/9-19 SR 8.2.1 Bulk composition In the context of the North Sea, the oil from DST#1 has a low API gravity (ca. 30° according to rig reports, Table 8.1) and a very high sulphur content (1.7%, Table 8.3). These properties are reflected in a high C15+ fraction (79%, Table 8.3) and very low saturated hydrocarbon content (30%, Table 8.3). The aromatic hydrocarbon content is exceptionally high (57%, Table 8.3), whilst asphaltenes are somewhat elevated (3%). The carbon isotopic composition (513C) of the oil (-27.8%o, Table 8.4) is slightly heavier than is usually observed in the North Sea, and individual fractions surprisingly show almost no variation (Fig. 8.3). 117STATOIL 8.2.2 Molecular composition Thompson's indices are given in Table 8.5 and show that the light hydrocarbons are depleted in branched and cyclic alkanes relative to n-alkanes and aromatics (e.g. high W, H, S)."
116,Geological Report_1160,"Pr/Ph ratio is very low from GC analysis of both the whole oil and saturated hydrocarbon fraction (0.64 and 0.65 respectively, Table 8.6). The chromatogram from analysis of the latter fraction (Fig. 8.4) reveals also relatively large amounts of acyclic isoprenoid alkanes and long chain n-alkanes compared to most North Sea oils. These features are reflected in a high Ph/nC1fl and low nC17/(nC17+nC27) ratio (Table 8.6). The GC trace of the aromatic hydrocarbon fraction (Fig. 8.5) contains abundant phenanthrenes which resulted in calculation of relatively low F1, F2 and MPI1 parameters in Table 8.7. The mass fragmentograms from GCMS analysis of the saturated hydrocarbons (Fig. 8.6) and parameters derived therefrom (Table 8.8) are unusual in several respects. Most notable are the high relative abundances of bisnorhopane (C28o|3/H = 0.58) and C35o(5 hopanes (35/34H = 1.03) in m/z 191. Other noteworthy features are the low diasterane/regular sterane ratio in m/z 217 (dia/reg = 0.72), low hopane/sterane ratio (H/S = 3.12) and high C^ sterane abundance (C30/st = 0.10)."
117,Geological Report_1170,"The GCMS analysis of the aromatics fraction resulted in an inability to identify the monoaromatic steroids in m/z 253 (Fig. 8.7) due to the presence of other components, and hence failure to measure parameters Aroml and Arom2 (Table 8.9). The triaromatic steroids were recognisable however and Crackl and Crack2 are reported in Table 8.9. The values for both are moderate to low. 8.3 Thermal maturity 8.3.1 Gas The gas has a normal hydrocarbon composition with a gas ""wetness"" (0.14 for bottom hole sample, Table 8.2) which suggests a relatively mature sample. However, the ""zigzag"" isotopic compositions of the hydrocarbons (see section 8.1 and Fig. 8.2) are extremely unusual and are not interpretable using currently accepted isotopic models of gas generation. Hence, no reliable estimate of the thermal maturity of the gas can be made. 118STATOIL 8.3.2 Oil Both the 20S and 22S biomarker parameters (0.54 and 0.60 respectively) have reached ""equilibrium"" values, which generally occurs at or around the onset of petroleum generation. There are other bulk and molecular properties which suggest that the oil was generated relatively early in the oil generation window (OGW)."
118,Geological Report_1180,"API gravity is low (ca. 30°), saturated hydrocarbon content is very low (30%), acyclic isoprenoids are high relative to n-alkanes (Ph/nC18 ca. 1), there are relatively abundant long chain n-alkanes, the pp parameter (0.56) has not reached its maximum (""equilibrium"") value of ca. 0.7. However, the source parameters (section 8.4, below) suggest an unconventional source rock (in a North Sea context) for the oil, which - if true - may also have affected some of the maturity parameters. Hence, it is probably safest to conclude that generation of the oil occurred over the early (lower temperature) to main phase of the OGW. 8.4 Source classification 8.4.1 Gas The hydrocarbon composition of this gas resembles, in particular, gas from Sleipner Vest (see section 8.5). However, the ""zigzag"" trend shown by the carbon isotopes, illustrated in Fig. 8.2 and discussed in section 8.1, is beyond the scope of current models and makes it impossible to classify the source of the gas. The amount of carbon dioxide in the gas is relatively high (7.6% in the bottom hole sample, Table 8.2) and has a carbon isotope value of -8.0%0."
119,Geological Report_1190,"These factors together suggest that the source was mostly thermal degradation of inorganic carbonate (James, 1985). 8.4.2 Oil The oil properties, both bulk and molecular, are remarkably consistent in indicating that this sample was generated from a non-clastic marine source rock - i.e. not the Kimmeridge Clay Formation (KCF) or equivalent (Draupne Formation here) in its normal form. Key features which support this interpretation are: i) bulk properties such as the API gravity and high sulphur content (30° and 1.7% respectively) ii) biomarker parameters including low Pr/Ph ratio (0.65), high bisnorhopane (C28ap/H 0.58), low diasteranes (dia/reg 0.72), abundant extended hopanes 119STATOIL (35/34H 1.03). All of the above are characteristic of oils from carbonate/siliceous source rocks and are unusual for a North Sea oil. Other parameters, such as C30/st, confirm that the source rock was deposited in a marine environment Thus the oil was most likely generated from a non-clastic (i.e. carbonate or siliceous) marine source rock. This could have been either an Upper Jurassic KCF equivalent with an unusual facies, or a completely different and as yet undiscovered source. 8.5 Comparison of Theta Vest with Sleipner Øst, Loke and Sleipner Vest Sleipner Øst, Loke and Sleipner Vest have been the subjects of recent geochemicai reports (Statoil, 1993g; Statoil, 1993h). The following is a summary of the main conclusions for these areas."
120,Geological Report_1200,"8.5.1 Sleipner Øst and Loke The hydrocarbon gases have very similar chemical and isotopic compositions throughout the Heimdal and Hugin Formations, both in Sleipner Øst and Loke. Only the amount of CO2 shows any trend amongst the gas components, being in lower abundance in the Heimdal Formation than the Hugin. Low amounts of CO2 tend also to be slightly isotopically lighter. The gas was probably generated from either coals or marine sediments with significant land plant input, at thermal maturities corresponding to the end of the oil window. The hydrocarbon gases in Sleipner Øst are wetter and isotopically lighter than in Sleipner Vest, indicating that they were generated at a somewhat lower maturity. The very low amounts of CO2 in the Heimdal Formation were probably co-sourced with the hydrocarbons; where concentrations are slightly higher in the Hugin Formation, this is a reflection of a separate input from thermal breakdown of carbonates. The condensates in the Heimdal Formation comprise a homogeneous data set, with no lateral (across the field) or vertical (intra-well) trends in geochemicai composition visible. In contrast, the condensates from the Hugin Formation on Sleipner Øst form a separate group with different geochemicai properties to those from the Hugin Formation in Loke and well 15/9-15. The latter are more similar in geochemicai properties to those from the Heimdal Formation. 120STATOIL The condensate in the Heimdal (all wells) and in the Hugin in well 15/9-15 and Loke may well have been co-sourced with the gas - or possibly have come from the same source rock type (dominated by terrestrial organic matter - OM) but at slightly lower thermal maturity."
121,Geological Report_1210,"In contrast, the condensate in the Hugin on Sleipner Øst came originally from a conventional oil-prone marine source rock, and corresponds to a fluid generated at top of the oil window or onset of oil to gas cracking. The condensate was probably dissolved in the gas phase by the later-generated gas from a terrestrial source. 8.5.2 Sleipner Vest On Sleipner Vest the bulk of the gas has been derived from a different source than the oil/condensates. Source variations have also been recognized amongst the oil/condensates. The gases have a very uniform hydrocarbon composition, characteristic of condensate- associated material generated at a maturity level of approx. 1 -1.5% R0. The coals of the Hugin and Sleipner Fm. are the most likely source rocks for this gas, but at greater burial depths than those present in the Sleipner Vest field. CO2 content in the gases increases when going from the southern part of the field both in northern and eastern direction. This trend coincides with a larger-scale regional variation in both content and isotopic ratio of CO2, which is thought to be related to the input of an isotopically heavy, CO2-rich gas from the Viking Graben into this area."
122,Geological Report_1220,"The composition of the condensates from Sleipner Vest is very uniform, with the exception of well 15/9-1 (both oil and condensate). This indicates that the latter well is located in an isolated field segment which has received a stronger influx of material derived from marine OM (Draupne Formation?). All the other condensates have been generated from source rocks containing both terrestrial and marine OM. This could be a more terrestrial facies of the Draupne Formation (compared to 15/9-1) or it could reflect mixing of petroleum generated from the Draupne with that from a terrestrially dominated source (Hugin/Sleipner coals?). 8.5.3 Comparison with Theta Vest Figure 8.8 contains a comprehensive classification of fluids (gases, condensates and oils) discovered to date in the greater Sleipner area. The fluid types are classified according to field/structure, formation, thermal maturity and source rock type. Note that it applies only to the hydrocarbon components of the gases - carbon dioxide is dealt with separately below. The figure shows that four different source rock types/combinations and four maturity levels have been identified to date (excluding the undassifiable gas from Theta Vest). The following general points can be made: 121STATOIL - throughout the area, the thermal maturity level apparently increases, as might be expected, in the order oils < condensates < gases; - no attempt has been made to discriminate between.thermal and phase effects. Thus the former may in fact be due to the latter (e.g."
123,Geological Report_1230,"condensate in 15/9-1 may be a phase and not a thermal process) and hence the thermal maturity categories are deliberately broad and overlap; - the oil from Theta Vest is unique in coming from a non-clastic marine source rock and has many properties which are very unusual for the North Sea province; - the Draupne Formation (KCFs) is the source of a) the oil in 15/9-1, Sleipner Vest; b) the condensates in 15/9-1 and in wells from the Hugin Formation on Sleipner Øst; - coals, or a marine source rock dominated by terrigenous OM, are the proposed source of i) the condensates and the gas in the Heimdal Formation on both Sleipner Øst and Loke, as well as ii) the gas in the Hugin Formation on both Sleipner Øst and Loke and iii) the gas in the Hugin Formation on Sleipner Vest; - a mixed terrigenous/marine OM source was most likely for the condensate in the Hugin Formation on Sleipner Vest (i.e. either a mixture of fluids from a coal and Draupne Fm. source or a single source rock with a mixed organic input). Thus in summary it can be seen that there are wide variations in source rock type of the oils, condensates and gases across the Sleipner area. The oil and gas from Theta Vest have properties which are unlike those for any other fluid found elsewhere in the area. The origin of carbon dioxide in the area is, in one sense, simpler in that there are only two proposed sources: either low amounts generated from OM in the source rock or high amounts from an inorganic carbonate source. These two origins can be distinguished on the basis of the carbon isotope values, as illustrated by Fig. 8.9 which shows %CO2 in the gas versus 513C for C02 for all samples from the area. It was reported previously that the CO2 in Sleipner Vest is more abundant and comes predominantly from breakdown of inorganic carbonate; in contrast the low amounts in Sleipner Øst and Loke originate mostly from OM degradation. However, the CO2 from Theta Vest resembles that from Sleipner Vest in terms of abundance and isotopic composition, and as such is in contrast to other samples from the Sleipner Øst area."

The definition and delineation of prospects and leads in the Theta Vest area, will be based on an analysis of structures, source rocks, source areas, migration paths, spill routes and relations/lack of relations between discovered hydrocarbon accumulations with respect to pressures and chemistry. 9.1 Definition of structures A structural description and analysis of the Sleipner area, is given under Chapter 4.3 in this report. It has been found that a more detailed description and understanding of the Theta Vest - Loke area itself can be obtained by combining information from mapped faults, lineaments observed on seismic attribute maps, isochores and depth maps. In the following, some of the main observations that can be made concerning the structures of the area, are summarized. 9.1.1 Faults and fault directions The mapped faults in the area are marked on the depth map of the Top Mesozoic Sandstone given in Enclosure 5 and Figure 3.9. The faults orientations in this area are similar to the directions observed for many other areas in block 15/9. Three main directions dominate: NE-SW, NW-SE and N-S."
130,Geological Report_1300,"Many faults are combinations of these directions. The main fault, bounding the Theta Vest - Loke area to the west, has a dominant NE- SW direction. It actually represents a combination of NE-SW and N-S directions. In the Theta Vest - Loke area and north and south to this area, numerous faults are shown. Some of these can be followed over distances of more than a kilometer, others only over distances of 200-500 meters. This gives an overall impression of many scattered faults with limited continuity. However, some of the faults line up indicating the possible presence of more continous faults that can not be mapped on the present seimic data. 9.1.2 Lineaments Seismic attribute maps (amplitude, azimuth and dip maps) over the seismically mapped horizons (Base Cretaceous and Top Mesozoic Sandstone) have been used together with timeslices, to extract information on lineaments in the area. The seismic attribute maps are given in Enclosure 6-11. The lineament information from these maps are shown on a separate map in Enclosure 15."
131,Geological Report_1310,"The map shows abundant lineaments disecting the area. Again three directions dominate: NW-SE (strong and abundant over the whole area), NE-SW (strong and abundant, especially in the western part) and N-S (seems to be limited to an area north of a strong NW-SE lineament cutting the area south of the Loke structure and north of the Theta Vest 150STATOIL structure). The lineaments are parallel to and coincides with the mapped faults, but they also extends and continues over areas where no faults are directly mapped from the seismic. 9.1.3 Isochores Several isochores have been generated as difference maps from the seismically mapped horizons: a) Top Shetland Gr. - Base Cretaceous Unconformity (Figure 9.1 and Enclosure 16) b) Top Shetland Gr. - Top Blodøks Formation (Figure 9.2 and Enclosure 17) c) Top Blodøks Formation - Base Cretaceous Unconformity (Figure 9.3 and Enclosure 18) d) Base Cretaceous - Top Mesozoic Sandstone (Figure 5.14 and Enclosure 19) These maps reveal information concerning thickness distributions, which are important for the understanding of the structuring of the area. Map d) reveals that the area can be divided into several distinct subareas with respect to the thickness of the Jurassic shales (the Viking Group). North of the Theta Vest structure, an area with very thick shales, in the range of 100-150 m, is situated. This area is bounded to the east by a well defined N-S fault. East of this fault there is a well defined area with thicknesses of 40-60 m. This area again, is bounded to the east by more scattered faults."
132,Geological Report_1320,"East of this area and in the Loke area, the thickness is in the range 10- 20 meters. Similar thickness of 10-20 m is observed over the Theta Vest structure and south of the structure. This abrupt and distinct variations in the thickness of the Upper Jurassic shales, are indicative of distinct fault blocks and segments with different deposition/erosion of the shales. The isochore maps of the Cretaceous horizons (a) and c)), show thickness distributions that do not coincide/match with that of the Jurassic shales. The thicknesses vary more across the NE-SW and the NW-SE directions. A pronounced fault block orientated NE-SW is defined west of the Theta Vest structure, partly cutting the western part of this structure. North of the Theta Vest structure and west of the Loke structure, a more NW-SE orientated basin/fault block with large thicknesses of the Cretaceous is situated. This is partly oblique to the underlying fault blocks observed on the Top Mesozoic Sandstone map. 9.1.4 Depth maps The depth maps for the Base Cretaceous and the Top Mesozoic Sandstone (Figure 3.5 and 3.9), displays numerous highs and lows over the Theta Vest - Loke area. These have shapes and boundaries that coincide with the dominant directions of faults and lineaments."
133,Geological Report_1330,"The NW-SE direction is especially prominent on these maps, but also N-S and NE-SW directions take part in the shaping of highs and lows. This strongly indicates that faults and lineaments are underlying the shaping of the 151O STATOIL structures, although these are mapped with distinct displacements only over parts of the area with the present seimic data. 9.1.5 Structural areas By combining the information and analysis given above, it is possibly to disect the mapped area into several subareas each representing distinct structural areas. Eight (8) major areas, denoted ""polygons"", have been defined. The polygons are plotted on the structural depth map of the Top Mesozoic Sandstone in Figure 9.4. Each polygon has been labeled with letters from A to I. The polygons and their structures are described, and the possible closure of the structures evaluated. Polygon A This area represents a structural low on the depth map and a fairly well defined down faulted block. It contains a distinct and very thick package (100-150 m) of Upper Jurassic shale. The block is bounded to the west by the NE-SW striking main fault and to the east by a well defined N-S trending fault with a throw of about 100 m. This throw is significantly larger than the expected thickness of the Hugin Formation reservoir sand in the area (30- 40 m)."
134,Geological Report_1340,"This, together with the thick Jurassic shale on the downthrown side of the fault, suggests a high probability for this fault to be sealing. The area is limited to the south(-west) by a strong NW-SE striking lineament. Minor faults parallel to this lineament are also mapped. Across this lineament, both the structural depth map and the isochores have relatively dense contouring indicating rapid changes across the lineament This changes could represent faulting and/or erosion. However, it is impossible to conclude wether sealing is present or not in this area. Polygon B This area also represents a structural low on the Top Mesozoic Sandstone depth map. The isochore map of the Upper Jurassic shale in the area is distinctly thinner than in Polygon A and distinctly thicker than what is observed north, east and south of the polygon (see paragraph 9.1.3). The area is bounded to the west by the well defined N-S striking fault. The polygon is bounded to the NW by the main fault, to the NE by a strong NW-SE lineament, which in part is represented by a well defined fault. The eastern boundary is poorly defined with few and scattered faults."
135,Geological Report_1350,"This boundary is partly defined by mapped lineaments and the change in the isochore thickness of the Upper Jurassic shale. The combined information from the Upper Jurassic shale isochore and the faults present, indicates in general a throw of about 20-30 m for mapped and unmapped faults along the north and east boundary of the polygon. With an expected sand thickness of the Hugin Formation of 20-40 meters, this throw will be on the limit for sealing. The south(-west) boundary of the polygon is defined by a strong NW-SE lineament. Some scattered faults are mapped in this area parallel to the lineament. For the south(-west) boundary, the same reasoning as used for polygon A described above, is applied. 152O STATOIL Polygon C (Theta C) This structure is located right west of the Theta Vest on the downthrown side of the main fault. On the downthrown side of the fault, the contours on the Top Mesozoic Sandstone depth map dip gradually down towards the west and the basin between the Gamma High and Sleipner Vest. Towards NE and SW, the contours close against the main fault. These two points of contour closure against the main fault, both coincide with points where two of the major and most well defined NW-SE lineaments of the area are observed to intersect the main fault."
136,Geological Report_1360,"Also distinct changes of the direction of the main fault are observed at those points. It is believed that significant movements along these two lineaments have played an important role in the structural shaping of the whole area. The polygon can therefore be sealed off against the two lineaments. This gives the possibility of much larger hydrocarbon columns than expected from the closing contour alone. Polygon D (Theta Vest) The Theta Vest structure is located east of the main fault. The structure has an overall dome shaped appearence and appearantly a well defined spill point to the east. A closer examination of the maps, shows that the structure and its surroundings have a very complicated structural appearance. The structure is surrounded by many faults and lineaments that follow the three main directions observed in the Sleipner area; NE-SW, NW-SE and N-S. On the structure itself, several faults with these directions are mapped to intersect each other in a complicated and irregular pattern. Several of the faults have throws in the order of tens of meters, sufficient to cut out the reservoir across the faults. Especially, the crest and the northern part of the structure is cut into several segments that can be isolated from each other."
137,Geological Report_1370,"In contrast, the depth map does not show any fault or combination of faults that can be followed across the whole structure. Appearently, there is structural continuity east-west over the southern flank of the structure between the 15/9-19SR well and towards the spill point to the east. Keeping strictly to the depth map, one can consider that the 15/9-19 SR well has proved hydrocarbons for the whole structure more or less. However, the possibility that one or several of the faults can have an unmapped extension southwards across the structure can not be disregarded, leaving open some probability of fault sealing across the structure. To take care of this uncertainty, the structure has been divided into one western and one eastern segment by following some of the most dominant faults and fault directions on the structure (Figure 10.4). The western segment contains the 15/9-19 SR well and is considered to be proven. The eastern segment is considered not proved, but with a high probability of hydrocarbons to be present Polygon E On the structural depth map, this area is seen as ""low"" situated south-west of the Theta Vest structure. The area is bounded to the west and the south by the main fault. To the east the area is bounded by a small horst like structure. A couple of faults are mapped along this boundary."
138,Geological Report_1380,"The contours on the depth map are closely spaced suggesting a fault controlled boundary. To the north, this area is bounded by the Theta Vest structure. This northern boundary is seen as an elongate E-W ""depression"" that is aligned with faults along the southern boundary of the Theta Vest dome structure. It is probable that the 153STATOIL ""depression"" is an expression of similar faults/or a fault zone. On the isochore maps the area is very distinct with large thicknesses for the Upper Jurassic shales. All data indicate that this area represent a downfaulted block. The maps further indicate that the area represents the southern part of a larger fault block extending north-east wards along the main fault, cutting also the western part of the Theta Vest structure. The probability that this fault block is sealed towards the west, south and east is considered very high. Polygon F This represents a small well defined NE-SW orientated horst block. It is bounded to the west and the east by well defined ""lows"" on the depth structure map."
139,Geological Report_1390,"On the isochore maps, there is a strong contrast in thickness between this ""high"" and the ""lows"" to the east and west, supporting that this represents a horst. To the north and the Theta Vest structure, the horst is bounded by a distinct fault with throw down to the south. The throw of this fault is approximately 50 m. Both to the north and the south, the contours of the horst narrows into possible spill points lying approximately 40 m below the highest point of the horst. At the southern spillpoint, a small fault striking NW-SE and beeing parallel to a very strong NW-SE lineament (Enclosure 5) further to the south, is mapped. Polygon G (Theta Sør) The Theta Sør structure is surrounded by the Theta Vest structure to the north-west, the Loke structure to the north-east and the Sleipner Øst structure to the south. On the structural depth map, the structure apparently has spill points from the Theta Vest, the Loke and the Sleipner Øst structures. No major faults seem to cut the structure on the present map. However, well defined strong lineaments striking NW-SE are seen on both sides of the structure. The structure itself has an overall NW-SE orientation and a horstiike appearence on the structural depth maps. Scattered faults with NW-SE strike are also mapped on and around the structure."
140,Geological Report_1400,"Also several scattered faults with NE-SW strike are mapped on and around the structure. The contour terminating the structure towards south-east, strike in the same direction. This indicates that faulting has been important in the shaping of the structure. Thus, the present map which shows the structure is in communication through spill points with the Theta Vest, the Loke and the Sleipner Øst structures, most probably gives an oversimplified picture of the relations between these structures. Polygon H and I (Loke) The Loke structure can be divided into several structural subareas. The north - western part of the structure (polygon H) has a dome-shaped appearance. Around this dome is mapped several faults with NW-SE, NE-SW and N-S strikes. Several faults with these directions are also mapped on the structure. This dome-like structure goes over into a more sadel shaped area to the south-east. This area again represents a bridge over to the south-eastern part of the structure."
141,Geological Report_1410,"The shape of the south-eastern part of the structure is orientated more NE-SW and faults with this direction is mapped in this area. The Loke structure is a complicated and composite structure. A reevalution of the Loke structure and discovery, including a new resource analysis, will be performed in the near 154O STATOIL future and be reported separately. 9.2 Evaluation of hydrocarbon source, migration and spill routes 9.2.1 Source rocks Extensive new geochemical analyses of all available hydrocarbon samples from the Sleipner area has been undertaken during 1993 (Statoil, 1993g & 1993h). The analyses show that at least three different source rocks are involved in the generation of hydrocarbons to the Sleipner area (Chapter 8 and Figure 8.8 in this report): Type 1 Coal type source rock or shale with terrestrial organic matter (Sleipner and Huqin Formations) a) source for the gas in the Hugin Formation on the Sleipner Vest structure b) source for the gas and the condensate in the Heimdal Formation on the Sleipner Øst and the Loke structures c) source for the condensate in the JurassioTriassic reservoir on the Loke structure. d) source for the gas in the Hugin Formation on the Sleipner Øst and Loke structures. Type 2 Shale type source rock (Draupne Fm.) a) source for the oil in the Sleipner Vest structure (15/9-1) b) source for the condensate/oil in the Hugin Formation on the Sleipner Øst structure. Type 3 Mixed type source rock (terrestrial/marine-mixture of source from type 1 and il a) source for the condensate in the Hugin Formation on the Sleipner Vest structure Type 4 Non-clastic marine source rock (carbonates?/unknown Draupne fades?) a) source for the oil in the Theta Vest structure."
142,Geological Report_1420,"This source rock type is unusual in the North Sea. In addition, the gas in Theta Vest can not be typed due to its unusual isotopic composition. This information about source rock type can be regrouped by reservoir and structure: THETA VEST - HUGIN FORMATION OIL: Type 4 GAS: unclassified 155STATOIL LOKE - TRIASSIC AND JURASSIC CONDENSATE: Type 1 GAS: Type 1 SLEIPNER ØST - HUGIN FORMATION CONDENSATE/OIL: Type 2 GAS: Type 1 This information reveals that: the compositions of the hydrocarbons in the Theta Vest structure are not related to the compositions of the hydrocarbons in either the Loke or the Sleipner Øst structure the gases in the Loke and the Sleipner Øst structures have a common source rock the condensates of the Loke and the Sleipner Øst structures are not related and have different source rocks. From this it can be concluded that compositions of the liquid hydrocarbons in the reservoirs of Theta Vest, the Loke and the Sleipner Øst structures are in general not related, and do not have common source rocks. These hydrocarbons have not been mixed during migration. It means that they probably have followed separate migration paths and are not related through spill from one structure to another. Only the gases of the Loke and the Sleipner Øst structures are related and can have followed the same migration paths and have a connection through spill. 9.2.2 Source areas Two main source areas are identified: I) The South Viking Graben area west of the Sleipner Vest Field Source rock 1 (Sleipner/Hugin Formation coals/shales) is early - mid mature for condensate formation and late mature for gas formation. Source rock 2 (Draupne Fm. shales) is early - mid mature for oil generation and late mature for condensate formation."
143,Geological Report_1430,"II) Local basin(s) between the Sleipner Vest Field and the Gamma High The Base Cretaceous structural depth map over the Sleipner area (Enclosure 3/Figure 3.5) shows the presence of a well defined basin area between the northern part of the Sleipner Vest Field and the Theta Vest - Loke area of 156O STATOIL the Gamma High. The basin area extends towards north-east out of the map area. Probably, it is connected with the Viking Graben area north of the Sleipner Vest and Dagny Field. This basin area terminates towards south-west against å prominent NW-SE lineament that can be followed across the central part of the Sleipner Øst structure and further north-west north of the Delta and Beta structures of the Sleipner Vest Field (see Figure 4.8). The deepest part of this basin area, approximately 3550 meters (base Cretaceos level), is situated right next to the Theta Vest-Loke area. In this basin area source rock 1 (Sleipner/Hugin Formation coals/shales) is early - mid mature for condensate formation. Source rock 2 (Draupne shales), is early - mid mature for oil formation. This source area is the most probable source area for the Theta Vest oil. Long range migration from more distant source areas (like the Viking Graben) would lead to mixing with hydrocarbons from other sources and therefore can be excluded. This source area is also less mature than source area I, and thus a more likely source area for the Theta Vest oil, which has a low maturity."
144,Geological Report_1440,"The source rock of the Theta Vest oil (carbonates or an unusual facies of the Draupne Fm.) is early-mid mature. Ill) Local basin south of the Sleipner Øst Field and the My structure This is a fairly shallow sub-basin and it is questionable if it is mature for hydrocarbon formation. 9.2.3 Migration paths Migration from two of the identified source areas (I and II) and into the Sleipner Øst - Loke - Theta Vest area, requires migration across the main fault zone between the Sleipner Terrace and the Gamma High. In general, the throw at base Cretaceous level is in the range of 200-300 meters across this main fault. This is sufficient to exclude sand to sand contact of the Hugin Fm. across the fault over large areas. In the area west and north of the Theta Vest - Loke area, where the strike of the main fault turns from N-S to NE-SW, a more gentle slope between the Gamma High and the Sleipner Terrace excist (see Enclosure 3/Figure 3.5). In this area, the main fault also has the smallest throw: down to 70 meters on the base Cretaceous level. This area is one of the most likely area for migration from the Sleipner Terrace to the Gamma High area."
145,Geological Report_1450,"At the base of this slope area, is the source area basin II. Up side of the slope, the Theta Vest and the Loke area is situated. A second possible migration route from the Sleipner Terrace to the Gamma High, is found at the extreme southern area of the Sleipner Øst Field itself. Here the base Cretaceous depth map shows a fairly gradual transition from the Sleipner Vest Field area and to the southern area of the Sleipner Øst Field. 157STATOIL In summary, there exist two probable areas for migration from the Sleipner Terrace and into the Gamma High: i) an area located north of the Sleipner Øst structure, where the Theta Vest and Loke structures receive hydrocarbons from the early - mid mature local sub basin situated between the Sleipner Vest and Gamma High ii) an area at the southern end of the Sleipner Øst Field However, it can not be excluded that the main fault zone itself represents a possible migration path. This means that the migration would not have to be limited to the two areas described. 9.2.4 Spill routes The present depth structure map of the Top Mesosoic Sandstone, has well defined spill points between the positive structures (highs) in the Sleipner Øst - Loke - Theta Vest area. The following spill points have been identified: a spill point between Theta Vest and Theta Sør at 2945 mss a spill point between Loke and Theta Sør at 2840 mss a spill point between Theta Sør and Sleipner Øst at 2815 mss. None of the wells drilled on the Theta Vest, the Loke and the Sleipner Øst structures, have proved hydrocarbons below the spill points of each structure. It is therefore possible that a fill-spill relation exists between the structures."
146,Geological Report_1460,"Based on the relative depths of the identified spill points, the following spill routes are possible between the structures: i) spill from Theta Vest to Theta Sør to Sleipner Øst ii) spill from Loke to Theta Sør to Sleipner Øst iii) spill from Sleipner Øst to Theta Sør. From this it can be concluded that: a) hydrocarbons can not have spilled into Theta Vest from the other structures (Theta Sør, Loke or Sleipner Øst). This implies that: b) Theta Vest must have been sourced/charged by oil by direct migration through the northern migration area c) the oil that migrated into Theta Vest can have migrated further into Theta Sør and Sleipner Øst, but not into Loke. As gas would replace oil, and oil cannot replace gas in a structure, it can be concluded: 158O STATOIL d) migration of gas has not taken place through the Theta Vest structure. Further that: e) migration into Loke can not come from the south by spill from Sleipner Øst and Theta Sør. This means that the gas and condesate in Loke came through the northern migration area. This implies that: f) both oil, condensate and gas have migrated through the northern migration area. Since condensate and gas has not migrated into Theta Vest, this implies: g) there exist separate cooridors for migration in the northern migration area; a corridor for oil charging Theta Vest and a corridor for condensate and gas charging Loke. This deduction, that there might exist separate corridors for oil and gas migration in the northern area, can seem speculative. From a closer examination of the Base Cretaceous and Top Mesozoic Sandstone maps, it is found that the basinal area on the downfaulted side of the main fault is divided into several sub basins by horsts structures (see Enclosure 3 and 5/Figure 3.5, 3.9 and 4.8)."
147,Geological Report_1470,"One of these horst structures bridges the northern part of the Sleipner Vest Field with the Loke - Theta Vest area. The horst structure and this downfaulted area lie directly north of a very strong lineament that strikes NW-SE. The Theta Vest lie directly south of this lineament (see also Enclosure 15). The oil may have been generated in the sub-basins south of the horst structure and the lineament. It may have migrated along the crest of the Theta C structure and into the Theta Vest structure. The gas may have been generated in sub-basins north of the horst or in the Viking Graben. It may have migrated southwards into the horst area and then westwards into the Sleipner Vest structure and eastwards into the Loke area. The migration paths and spill routes that are suggested above are the ones thought most probable at present. However, other solutions to migration and spill into the Theta Vest - Loke - Sleipner Øst area, most probably exist. Figure 9.5 illustrates the suggested source areas, migration paths and spill routes."
148,Geological Report_1480,"This map is based on combined information from the B.C.U. and Top Mesozoic structural depth maps. 9.2.5 Pressure The reservoir pressure in the Theta Vest Hugin Formation has been compared to the pressures in equivalent formations in the adjacent wells 15/9-11 (Sleipner Øst) and 15/9- 17 (Loke). The relevant data and assumptions are shown in the Table 9.1 below. The fluid gradients are plottet in Figure 9.6. All depths are in m TVD MSL. 159STATOIL Table 9.1 Pressure In adjacent wells. 15/9-19 SR 15/9-11 15/9-17 RFT pressure (JcPa) DST pressure (kPa)n.a. 32770 (2863.9 m)29937 (2784.0 m) 29950 (2783.7 m)29627 (2717.7 m) 29710 (2718.1 m) Estimated pressure 33320 at 2945 m Applied gradients (kPa/m) gas oil 6.8 water31450 3.0 10.031230 3.0 10.0 Assumptions Oilfilled to spill pointGWC=2800 m (proven)GDT=2825 m The measured pressures are converted to a depth of 2945 m MSL This corresponds approximately to the spill point of the Theta Vest structure. As can be seen from the table, there is a pressure difference of approximately 2000 kPa between well 15/9-19 SR and the other two wells."
149,Geological Report_1490,"The pressure data exclude a direct continuity and contact between the hydrocarbon accumulation in the Theta Vest structure and those in the Sleipner Øst and the Loke structures at present. The analysis also shows that the pressures of the Loke and the Sleipner Øst structures are nearly similar. This implies that: the Theta Vest structure can not be in communication with the Loke or the Sleipner Øst structures communication can exist between the Loke and the Sleipner Øst structures and probably through the Theta Sør structure. 9.3 Definition of prospects and leads The structural analysis has shown that most of the structures are bounded by faults and lineaments. Some of the faults have been described to have a potential for sealing due to significant throw across these faults. However, none of the structures are completely surrounded by such faults. At one or several sides the limit/boundary of the structures have been defined by lineaments that are not accompanied by a (significant) vertical throw across the lineament. This gives a lack of closure for most downfaulted structures. 160STATOIL Appearently there are open structural contact through spill points/lack of closure between all highs and lows in the mapped area. If this picture was a true representation of the area, a simple fill-spill relation between all structures, pressure communication between the structures and hydrocarbons with geneticly related compositions should be expected."
150,Geological Report_1500,"However, the pressure data and lack of genetic relationship between the compositions of the hydrocarbon discoveries indicates that there are no communications between the Theta Vest structure and respectively the Loke and Sleipner Øst discoveries at present. Where and what are the barrieres between the discoveries and other structural highs and lows in the area? The analysis of lineaments from the seismic attribute maps have revealed several and many major lineaments crossing the area between the highs and lows. Across many of these lineaments, significant changes in the thicknesses on the seismically derived isochores have been observed. In summary, there are many lineaments that can represent candidates for the sealing between structures. However, it is impossible from the present data to conclude which of these lineaments actually are sealing. At present, the simplest approach in the definition of prospects, is that none of the lineaments are sealing. Thus, only highs with an elevation above the spill points of the discoveries are considered to have hydrocarbon potential and can be defined as prospects. This will include only the Theta Vest, the Loke and the Theta Sør structures. The prospects defined, are as a maximum filled to their spill points."
151,Geological Report_1510,"Lows or downthrown faultblocks are at best considered as possible leads with one exception: the downfaulted Theta C structure which has a defined closure against the main fault. This structure is defined as a prospect. It is believed that this simple approach gives the minimum hydrocarbon potential for the area. The presence of sealing faults may define fluid contacts deeper than the mapped spill points. Structural highs, or part of them, can be filled below their closing contours. Downfaulted blocks can aslo be sealed. Such a situation will significantly increase the hydrocarbon potential of the area. It is believed that sealing faults are active in the area as it is in the Sleipner Vest area, and as indicated from the pressure and geochemical data. However, due to limited hard data from the seimic mapping, only the simple approach outlined above is applied in the present resource evaluation of the area. 161THETA VEST AREA sochore .Shetland - BCUSTATOIL 431000 432000 433000 434000 435000 436000 437000 438000 439000 440000 441000 442000 451000 432000 433000 434000 435000 436000 437000 438000 439000 440000 441000 442000 S Meter O 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 Figure 9.1THETA VEST AREA Isochore T.Shetland - T.BIodoksSTATOIL 431000 432000 433000 434000 435000 436000 437000 438000 439000 440000 441000 442000 431000 432000 433000 434000 435000 436000 437000 438000 439000 440000 441000 442000 S 102-120120-160160-200200-240240-280280-320320-360360-400400-440440-478Meter 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 Figure 9.2THETA VEST AREA Isochore T.BIodoks - BCUSTATOIL 431000 432000 433000 434000 435000 436000 437000 438000 439000 440000 441000 442000 431000 432000 433000 434000 435000 436000 437000 438000 439000 440000 441000 442000 S Meter 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 Figure 9.3STRUCTURAL DEPTH MAP Top Mesozoic sandstone and defined polygonsSTATOIL 431000 432000 433000 434000 435000 436000 437000 441000 442000 432000 433000 434000 435000 430000 437000 438000 43SOOO 440000 441000 442000 Meter 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 Figure 9.4 Structural depth map of the Top Mesozoic Sandstone with the defined polygons."

The resource parameters are the parameters that are used in the calculations of the in place and recoverable resources. Evaluation of the parameters is accomplished by recording a minimum, most likely and a maximum value for each parameter. The minimum value is equivalent to the lowest expected value in a discovery of economical interest The most likely value is the value expected to be found, based on the evaluation. The maximum value is equivalent to the highest value that can be expected. The different resource parameters are tied to different probability attributes. The attributes involved are: hydrocarbon source and migration, closure and potential reservoir facies. For each of these attributes one has to assign a value between 0 (not present) and 1.0 (present). The discovery probability is found by multiplying the estimated probability attributes. The estimated parameters have been Monte-Carlo simulated to give possible distributions of the resource estimates."
153,Geological Report_1530,"The hydrocarbon contacts and the reservoir thicknesses have been used in the software package IRAP to calculate the rock volumes. The basis for the calulation of the reservoir rock volume has been the depth converted Top Mesozoic time map. The resource estimations for the Theta Vest structure includes a: resource estimation without any segmentation of the structure (Chap. 10.1) resource estimation where the structure is divided into two segments (Chap. 10.2) The resource estimations for the Theta C and the Theta Sør prospect are given in Chapter 10.3 and 10.4. The input and results of the resource simulations for each prospect, are given in Table 10.1 to 10.5. 10.1 The Theta Vest discovery Reservoir thickness The reservoir thickness of the Hugin Formation in the 15/9-19 SR well is 18 m TVT. The well is located high on the structure. The reservoir probably thickens downflanks due to less erosion/more deposition. In addition, several normal faults close to the well have been mapped from the seismic, and 829 fractures (assumed to be faults) are observed in the Jurassic and Triassic cores."
154,Geological Report_1540,"In Chapter 4.2 an analysis of the tectonic thinning of the Hugin Formation has been performed. The restored (primary) thickness of the formation has been calculated to 24.7 - 27 m TVT. This indicates that the 18 m thickness is the minimum. 168STATOIL The largest thickness of the Hugin Formation sandstone found in the Sleipner Øst area is about 36 m (15/9-11). For simplicity, it will be assumed that this is the maximum reservoir thickness on the Theta Vest structure. The most likely reservoir thickness is defined to be the arithmetic average of the minimum and maximum values. This value, which is 27 m, is in the agreement with the estimated unfaulted thickness of the Hugin Formation in Chapter 4.2.

This gives a proven oil column of 18 meters in the well."
155,Geological Report_1550,"The base of the oil column in the well is found at the boundary of the Hugin and the Skagerrak Formation. The boundary between the Hugin Formation and the underlying Skagerrak Formation is well defined and sharp (primary sedimentary contact) in the cores. The Hugin Formation shows dark brown oil staining, while the Skagerrak Formation has a light grey colour with no signs of oil staining, except for a weak staining in its uppermost 5 cm. This is confirmed by a distinct difference in fluorescence observed on the UV-light core photos. This lack of oil in the Skagerrak Formation is also confirmed by the resistivity log, which shows a distinct drop from high resistivity values in the Hugin Formation into low values in the Skagerrak Formation (see Figure 6.1). The observations can be interpreted in two ways: i) the 15/9-19 SR has hit a horizontal OWC that by incidence is located right at the boundary between the Hugin and the Skagerrak Formations ii) the Skagerrak Formation is tight and has so low permeability and porosity that oil could not penetrate into the formation. The first interpretation (i) is unlikely, while the second interpretation (ii) is strongly supported by core observations, core-plug measurements, mineralogy and the logs (see paragraphs 5.4.1, 5.5.3 and Figure 6.2). It can be concluded that the Skagerrak Formation is too tight to have been charged by oil, and that this formation forms an effective seal/barrier for oil migration below the Hugin Formation. This implies that the surface boundary between these two formations form the lower limit of oil over the structure. It is also unlikely that a water or gas contact is present very close to the well."
156,Geological Report_1560,"During the DST-test, the well produced only minor amounts of water. No changes in the water content or in the GOR of the fluid were observed. However, interpretation of the pressure data indicates pressure barriers approximately 65 and 250 m away from the well (see Chapter 7). At the same time, an increase in flow capacity is observed in the data. This has been modelled as a constant pressure boundary at a distance of approximately 125 m from the well. It is therefore a possibility of a gas cap above the oil. On the other hand, the presence of a gas cap seems unlikely due to the fact that the oil itself is undersaturated with respect to gas (bubble point pressure = 273 bar, reservoir pressure = 327.7 bar). Consequently, the well is probably in communication with a larger reservoir volume. Based on the well data, it has not been possible to determine any fluid contact(s) for the Theta Vest discovery. 169O STATOIL The base of the reservoir at 2882 m MSL could be the most shallow contact."
157,Geological Report_1570,"Since the top of the structure is found at 2754 m MSL and a gas cap is probably not present, this gives a minimum oil column of 128 m. Because the structure is situated near a possible oil kitchen, the supply of hydrocarbons is thought not to be a problem. As a base case, it is a sound approximation to believe that the dome structure is filled to spill point at 2945 m MSL, and that the spill point level equals the oil-water contact. The result is then an oil column of 191 m. Based on possible uncertainties in mapping of the spillpoint, five meters have been added to the defined spillpoint. Thus, a maximum oil column of 196 m is estimated with a hydrocarbon contact at 2950 m MSL. The prospect map, with minimum and most likely hydrocarbon columns colour coded, is presented in Figure 10.1. Rock volume From the IRAP volume calculations, the minimum, most likely and maximum rock volume is respectively 36105368 m3. 91203736 m3 and 121919760 m3. Petrophysical variables The distribution of the petrophysical parameters is based on the assumption that the facies of the Hugin Formation sand does not change over the structure. The distribution of the log and plug derived porosity and log derived water saturation values, through the Hugin Formation in the 15/9-19 SR well, has been used to estimate their possible minimum and maximum, values for the Hugin Fm. over the structure."
158,Geological Report_1580,"The distribution of the porosity values is represented in the frequency plot in Figure 10.2. To make it easier to visualize the distribution of values, a density plot along each axis is specified. The standard histogram plot in Figure 10.3 represents the distribution of the water saturation values. The most likely values are derived from the mean of the petrophysical results for the Hugin Formation in well 15/9-19 SR (see Table 6.2). The reservoir sand in the 15/9-19 SR well is very clean. The calculated net/gross is reduced due to carbonate cementation at the base of the reservoir. In places where the cementation does not occur, the net/gross value may be as high as 0.99. With a thicker interval of cementation than recorded in the well, a minimum net/gross value is assumed to be 0.9. Reservoir technological parameters From the PVT analyses the formation volume factor (B0) is 1.50 and 1.505 (see Table 7.6). The distribution in the shrinkage factor is estimated to be: 1/(B0 ± 0.05)."
159,Geological Report_1590,"The most likely is 1/1.50. The recovery factor is estimated to be 0.45. The factor is purely based on the test results, which indicate very good production capacities. However, a lot of faults are mapped on top of the structure. As mentioned earlier, one or several of these faults can have an unmapped extension across the structure. Several of the faults also have throws which are sufficient to cut out reservoir communication across the faults. These factors could give a lower recovery factor. 170STATOIL Based on the test results, the minimum recovery factor is expected to be 0.35 and the maximum value 0.50. The recorded gas-oil ratios from the PVT analyses are reported in Statoil (1993b) and Chapter 7. The total gas-oil ratios were 157 Sm3/Sm3 (single flash), 159.1 Sm3/Sm3 (single flash) and 169.0 SrrvVSm3 (diff."
160,Geological Report_1600,"vaporization). From these data a minimum value is estimated to be 150, a most likely to be 158 and a maximum value to be 169. Probability estimation The Hugin reservoir is present, the structure has a closure and oil is accumulated. A probability for recovery is therefore estimated to be 1.0. 10.2 The western and eastern segments of the Theta Vest structure Hydrocarbon volume - and reservoir technological parameters Apart from the hydrocarbon columns, the resource parameters are estimated to be the same as in the case of the Theta Vest prospect (Chapter 10.1). The hydrocarbon column estimates are different in the western segment. The highest structural point of this segment is 2790 m MSL and consequently deeper than for the eastern segment (2754 m MSL). The different columns are illustrated on the segment map in Figure 10.4. The IRAP calculated minimum, most likely and maximum rock volume is 18698840 m3, 50158036 m3 and 67045048 m3 for the western segment and 17401588 m3. 41047200 m3 and 54873172 m3 for the eastern segment."
161,Geological Report_1610,"Probability estimation Oil is proven in the 15/9-19 SR well in the western segment. This segment is therefore defined as a proven segment. The probability of discovery is estimated to be 1.0. The risk that no hydrocarbons have migrated from the western segment to the eastern due to sealing faults, is estimated to be 0.1. This gives an estimated probability of discovery of 0.9 for the eastern segment. 10.3 The Theta C prospect Reservoir thickness This prospect is defined on the hanging wall west of the main fault. The throw/slip across the fault is in the approximate order of 100 - 400 m in the prospect. Due to less erosion and more sediment accumulation, the thickness of the Hugin Formation sand may be larger than in the Sleipner Øst and the Theta Vest area. The prospect is situated near the boundary of the seismic interpretation of the Sleipner Øst seismic survey. This boundary nearly overlaps the seismic interpretation of the Sleipner 171O STATOIL Vest Field."
162,Geological Report_1620,"The interpretation is reported in Statoil (1993c). From the Hugin Fm. isochore map of the Sleipner Vest seismic survey interpretation, it seems that this prospect is situated near a transition zone between thick and thin Hugin Fm. isochore. The Hugin Formation sandstones thins northwards. The Hugin Fm. isochore in this area, which is a graben area, varies between 50 - 250 m. Since the prospect is located at the eastern margin of this graben, a maximum thickness of the reservoir is not probably more than 200 m. Near the main fault in the northern area, the sandstone thickness may be as thin as 50 m. The most probable thickness is estimated to be 100 m. Hydrocarbon column From the structural depth map of the Top Mesozoic Sandstone, the highest point on the prospect is picked at 3530 m MSL. The minimum hydrocarbon contact expected, is estimated to be at the closing contour of the Top Mesozoic Sandstone, which is the 3650 m contour. A minimum hydrocarbon column is thereby estimated to be 120 m. In the northern end of the prospect, the prospect is closing against the main fault at 3700 m MSL. The closing contour is 3650 in the southern part."
163,Geological Report_1630,"However, a broader fault zone may excist. Based on this assumption, the most likely contact is estimated at this depth. This gives a most likely hydrocarbon column of 170 m. The 3800 m contour is the last of all contours that are closing against the main fault in the northern end of the prospect. But, the contour is not closing against the main fault in the southern part. It is obvious from the seismic attribute maps that a well defined NW-SE lineament is extending across the NE-SW main fault in the southern part of the prospect (see the lineament map in Enclosure 15). As an upside possibility, this lineament could be sealing as a fault which could close at 3800 m MSL. A maximum column of 270 m is therefore expected. Rock volume The IRAP calculated minimum, most likely and maximum rock volumes are 78662712 m3. 197590912 m3 and 590406016 m3. Petrophysical variables The Hugin Formation sandstone in the Sleipner Vest wells lies at the same depth as this prospect."
164,Geological Report_1640,"Due to the fact that the prospect is situated on the same side of the main fault as the Sleipner Vest wells, it is reasonable to believe the sandstone fades is more like the Sleipner Vest Hugin fades than the Sleipner Øst Hugin fades. The well data from the Sleipner Vest wells have therefore formed the basis for the estimation of the petrophysical parameter distribution in this prospect. The average net/gross in the Hugin Formation sand was calculated for all the Sleipner Vest wells. The values vary from 0.058 - 0.913. The maximum value is estimated to be 0.9, the minimum value to be 0.5 and the most likely value to be 0.6. A frequency plot of log - and plug derived porosity values, through the Hugin Formation in the Sleipner Vest wells, was generated. The average log derived water saturation values from the Hugin Formation were calculated for each Sleipner Vest well. The values vary between 0.08 - 0.22. A histogram has been plotted of all the water saturation values inside 172O STATOIL this range of values. The frequency and histogram plots are given in Figure 10.5 and 10.6."
165,Geological Report_1650,"Based on those plots, the probable distribution of the values have been estimated. Reservoir technological parameters The top of the Hugin Formation in this prospect (3530 m MSL) is approximately 800 m deeper than the top of the Hugin Formation in the 15/9-19 SR well. The formation volume factor (B0) is estimated to be somewhat higher in this prospect than in the Theta Vest well, due to a larger depth. The factor is estimated to be 1.6. The most likely shrinkage factor is 1/B0 and the minimum and maximum shrinkage factors: 1/(B0 ± 0.05). As a consequence of a larger depth and therefore a higher pressure, the GOR ought to be higher in this prospect than in the 15/9-19 SR well. An increasing GOR in the order of 40-50 is expected. The recovery factor is reduced due to the assumption of poorer reservoir quality and more faults in this prospect than in the Theta Vest prospect. The most likely recovery factor is estimated to be 0.40. A variation of ±0.05 is expected."
166,Geological Report_1660,"Probability estimation The main risk factor in this prospect is the sealing potential of the main fault. This is a downfaulted prospect, and the possibility that the fault may not be sealing is high. The fault throw is approximately 100-400 m, and the Triassic sandstones in the foot wall may juxtapose the Jurassic Hugin Formation in the hanging wall. A sandstone to sandstone contact at the fault, may have led to a migration through the sands across the fault. However, if the juxtaposed sandstone is the tight Skagerrak Formation sandstone observed in the 15/9-19 SR well, the prospect may be closed. The probability that this trap is sucessfull is estimated to be 0.25. It is assumed that this prospect has a reservoir, the Hugin Formation. The porosity of the Hugin Fm. sandstones may be a problem in this prospect. Slumps, brecciation, secondary cementation etc., caused by faulting, will reduce the porosity."
167,Geological Report_1670,"The porosity is therefore risked to be 0.7. Because of the uncertainties in the reservoir properties of the prospect, the recovery may be a problem. Recovery is given a risk factor of 0.7. The reservoir probability is thus 0.49. The prospect is situated near the oil kitchen, so the supply of hydrocarbons are not believed to be a problem. The probability of source is of this reason estimated to be 1.0. The probability of disovery is consequently 0.12. 10.4 The Theta Sør prospect Reservoir thickness The top of the Theta Sør structure (2760 m MSL) is at nearly the same depth level as the top of the Theta Vest structure (2754 m MSL). It is therefore reasonable to estimate the same reservoir thickness distribution for this structure as for the Theta Vest structure. 173STATOIL Hydrocarbon column In the south, the structure has a well defined spill point, at 2815 m MSL, to the Sleipner Øst Field."
168,Geological Report_1680,"The most likely hydrocarbon contact has been estimated to be this spill point depth. An uncertainty of ±5 m for the spill point depth is estimated. This defines the minimum and maximum contact. A contact at 2815 ± 5 m MSL and a top of the structure at 2760 m MSL, gives a hydrocarbon column of 55 ± 5 m. Rock volume The IRAP calculated minimum, most likely and maximum rock volumes are 15439756 m3. 24015756 m3 and 32693052 m3. Petrophysical variables The Theta Sør prospect is located east of the Theta Vest structure and north of the 15/9- 11 well. The average petrophysical values of the Hugin resevoir in the 15/9-11 and 15/9- 19 SR wells, are approximately the same. The estimated parameters from the Theta Vest prospect, have therefore been used for this prospect. The petrophysical evaluation of the 15/9-11 well is reported in Statoil (1982). Reservoir technological data It is assumed that gas/condensate is accumulated in the Theta Sør structure, since spill points exist to both the Loke and the Sleipner Øst gas/condensate reservoirs."
169,Geological Report_1690,"Due to a lack of data, the data from the Hugin reservoir in the Sleipner Øst structure (15/9-11 and 15/9- 13) is estimated to be the most likely representative data for this prospect. For the gas recovery factor, an uncertainty of ±0.05 is expected. The distribution of the GOR is estimated to be 1200. Probability estimation The structure is a dome structure. The probability of closure is estimated to be 1.0. It is assumed that this prospect has the Hugin Formation as reservoir. The risk is whether or not gas/condensate is accumulated. Since the structure is situated at the possible spill route between the Loke and the Sleipner Øst structure, gas/condensate is assumed to be accumulated. Based on the evaluation of migration and spill routes in Chapter 9.2.3 and 9.2.4, this possibility seems to be most likely. The probability of source is therefore estimated to be 0.8."

The reevaluation of the Jurassic/Triassic will have the following aims: a) further appraisal of the Theta Vest discovery b) preparation for drilling and production of gas and condensate from the Jurassic discovery in Sleipner Øst c) updating of reservoir description and resource estimations for the Loke and My discoveries c) evaluation of the exploration/resource potential in general of the Jurassic/Triassic in the Sleipner Øst area. This reevaluation should take place in two major stages: 1) evaluations based on the present data including further interpretations of the reprocessed seismic data from 1992 2) evaluations after the new 3D seismic data has been acquired over the Sleipner Øst area in 1994, and after new data is available from production, appraisal and exploration wells to be drilled in the period 1995-97. In the following is given a short review of new studies that should be performed and the new data that will be acquired. 11.2 Evaluations based on the present data After this report is finished the reevaluation of the Triassic and Jurassic in general in the Sleipner Øst area will be continued on the present data."
189,Geological Report_1890,"This will mainly consist of a complete seismic remapping of the area based on the reprocessed seismic data from 1991. This data have poor quality on the Jurassic and Triassic level and will not allow a very detailed mapping and understanding of the structures and reservoir distribution. However, the best will be done to extract as much information as possible out of the available data. This mapping probably will have to form the basis for the location of the first production wells to be drilled to the Jurassic reservoir on the Sleipner Øst in 1995. The interpretation of the reprocessed seismic data is not expected to give a proper appraisal and exploration of the Jurassic and Triassic in general, but it could give some better understanding of structures and tectonics in the area. Concerning further geological evaluations of the present well data this will be continued in connection with the remapping of the Jurassic and Triassic in the Sleipner Øst Field. A petrophysical reevaluation of all available wells will take place in the near future. 186STATOIL 11.3 Acquisition of new data In the coming years new seismic data and new well data will become available for a revaluation of the Jurassic and Triassic in the Sleipner Øst area 11.3.1 New seismic data It has been decided that new 3D seismic data shall be acquired over the Sleipner Øst area during 1994. The survey shall cover the PL046 licence area of block 15/9 not covered by the Sleipner Vest 3D survey that is acquired during 1993. Acquisition will take place during autumn 1994, and the data will probably not be available for interpretation before the second half of 1995."
190,Geological Report_1900,"11.3.2 New well data The drilling of a total of four production wells to the Jurassic gas and condensate reservoir on Sleipner Øst is scheduled to start early in 1995. Drilling in the period 1995-1997 of two appraisal/exploration wells in the area of the Theta Vest discovery has been included in the long term work program and budget issued in 1993. 11.4 Evaluations based on new data The new seismic data and well data that will become available from 1995 will be evaluated continously. Significant improvements in the quality of the seismic data compared to the old data available at present, are expected. This will improve the mapping of the Jurassic and Triassic reservoirs and their resources in the Sleipner Øst area, form a sound basis for further exploration and appraisal in the area and eventually lead to a comprehensive evaluation of the resources in the area. 187STATOIL 12 REFERENCES Antonelll M.A., Aydin A. & Pollard D., 1993 Microstructure of deformation bands in porous sandstones at Arches National Park.

The  movement in the overlaying casing joint thus exer ted a momentum on the tip of the wooden beam. The  wooden beam was thrown into the air, passed over the HTS (horizontal transport system) and landed on  the edge of the cantilever deck. It travelled a distance of 14 m before it came to rest. The wooden beam landed in a ti lted manner across the cantilever gangway on the opposite side  (starboard) of the HTS. The beam was supported on th e cantilever handrail and a rack of drilling subs."

The FMS was readily available and the program also called for a hydraulic lock function on the slips in order to avoid  running dog collars.

It was decided to pick up the CDS tool from the transport cradle  on the rig floor by air winch and lifting cap instead of the  earlier suggestion by Peter Schmidt to pick  it up by lifting nubbin in the elevators. (This was done at 0540 hrs.) The elevators were removed in preparation for making up to th e CDS tool, the Top Drive raised out of the way and the CDS  tool lifted into the casing stump. Unfortunately there  was not enough weight from the tool itself to push the new packer cup past  the sealing face inside the  casing collar. It was decided to try and apply weight to the top of the tool  by putting the elevators back on again, but this was also  insufficient. I remembered that we had to apply almost 8t to the packer in  the rig up on Maersk Innovator and suggested making up the tool  to the Top Drive to achieve the necessary down force to allo w the tool to be low enough for us to complete the rig up. This was done and almost 5t was applied to  the CDS before the packer cup passed and the tool brought to a height where the  hoses could be attached to enable  us to function test the tool."
209,Completion Report_100,"( Completed at 0615 hrs)    It is possible that had we rigged it up w ith the lifting nubbin we would probably have been able to push the packer through at  the first attempt. Once the hydraulic hoses were accessible I realised that one of the crossover fittings supplied by the Hydraulic engineer ( the   male fitting to the pressure supply line ) did not fit the only other female connection on the Top Drive hoses. A toolbox talk was called to discuss the final rig up procedur e at 0630 hrs whereupon I pointed this out to the Toolpusher,  Kim, who called for the Hydraulic Engineer to assist. While the engineer was sourcing the correct fitting the ni ght shift rig crew handed over to the day shift crew. By 0730 hrs the anti rotation bracket an d all hoses were connected, however alth ough the release pressure and function  appeared as per requirements, the hydraulic gauge was showing no pressure reading. Again the Hydraulic Engineer was called to assist. After fault finding and by a process of elimin ation it was discovered that the first e ngineer who had made up the crossovers fo r  us pre job, had identified the wrong hose as the pressure hose. This whole exercise took us to 0850 hrs when the correct hose and fittings were attached to the tool and a successful function  test and reading of the pressure was achieved. The CDS tool was ready for use at 0900 hrs. There are a number of factors involved here which contributed to  the excessive amount of time be ing taken to rig up, namely:-     We did not properly consider the problems of landing the CDS tool in the casing as opposed to our usual practice of rigging  up from the rotary table."

The pump rate should be  reduced to 1200 lpm for the last 2-3 m3 prior to bu mp plug. Pre-job simulations indicate a maximum ECD in the B alder formation of 1,56 sg,  when simulated with 3000 lpm displacement rate and gauge hole. Prognosed  fracture gradient at this depth is 1,60 sg. Maximum  ECD below the 20” casing shoe  is 1,45 sg.

351,Drilling Report_610,"Appendix C.1.3   5.13.13 Liner Cementing  In order to ensure a good quality cement job, it is  recommended to displace base  oil, spacer and cement slurry into annulus at a pum p rate of 1000 – 1200 lpm. The pump rate should be reduced to 500 lpm for the last 2 - 3 m3 prior to bump  plug. In addition the liner should, if possible, be  rotated throughout the cement job    Pre-job simulations indicate a maximum ECD at secti on TD of 1,87 sg, when  simulated with 1200 lpm displacement rate and gauge  hole. Prognosed fracture  gradient at this depth is 1,92 sg. At the 9 5/8” casing shoe expected maximum  ECD is 1,53 sg, with a prognosed  fracture gradient of 1,84 sg. Mud properties used in ECD simulation are as follow s:  Density: 1,44 sg  Rheology: 53 – 41 – 29 – 24 – 19 – 14 - 12 (300 thr ough 30 rpm reading)    A 1,90 sg cement slurry design, using silica blend cement to avoid strength  retrogression due to high static temperatures,  is proposed for this cementing  operation. Total slurry volume is based on having T OC to above liner lap at 2866  m MD, and with an OH excess of 65%. Total volume to  be pumped is 27 m3. 8 m3 base oil and 15 m3 of 1,50 sg spacer should be  pumped ahead of the  cement slurry in order to ensure proper hole cleani ng. A detailed cement procedure with final simulations included will be sent to the rig  prior to the cement job."
